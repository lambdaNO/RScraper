It has not listed my Apple ID for a long time.  I've called the help line at Apple and was put on hold for a very long time and then a dial tone came on.  I gave them 2 call back numbers.  No one ever called.  I went on line to several ""Apple"" sites and the first thing I was asked to do was fill out my credit card information. I've been ripped off by many people during my 81 years on this earth.  Lately a lot. The older I get the more folks try to take advantage of me.  Apple already has enough money."
cie_B	Dave c	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Got an iphone 7From work, so i still have my samsung s7 and wifey has a huawei .the daughter has an iphone ( above the 7.i forget which one) issues with battery life and seperating screens on the last 2 she had.and poor slow dealings with apple getting it done. ( my samsung and the huawei has never broke so i cant compare here with service.)After using the iphone im not impressed. Awkward to use compared to android.wireless charging? Nope. Quality,screen res,camera,speed  ALL way below the other phones .its like using an 8 yr old samsung imo..WHY DO IPHONES COST SO MUCH? A 200 pound huwei is far superior...Living off their name from yrs ago imo. Outdated phone costing a fortune because of an apple logo.buy android....

They didn't tell me (call or email) to let me know that they couldn't change the battery on my phone and would need to send it away.  Had I known that, I wouldn't have booked the appointment.  Rang customer services.  I asked for an appointment and to compensate me for wasting my time asked that the battery replacement should be free. ""I can't do that"" but I can send you my details if you have any other questions....I suggested that she didn't bother.  As per the note below.  Expensive products but ineffective process for booking repairs. Not enough slots and when they mess up.  ""I can't help you"".  time to switch."
cie_B	CHRISTOPHER COOKE	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	Over complicated security that when your ring Apple help even they get there head rapped around it. Don’t worry about anyone stealing your data Apple can’t even work out how to get you through there system. And I quote “ but not to worry we can lock you out for 24 hours and it will reset so we can start again” thinking of a new phone don’t both let just smack your head against a wall it’s cheaper and easier
cie_B	Aislinn Lowrey	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	2	"While I enjoy the products, the service aspect is lacking at best. It is an absolute pain to setup a genius bar appointment and then if you want to change it, hopefully the link works! I've experienced inconsistent information which has translated into hours worth of chat / phone / and later today, an in person appointment. This evening when I go in, it will be the seventh representative to ""help"" me RETURN a device and transfer Apple Care! While every representative has been polite, they have not helped me resolve the issue, in fact, they often mention that it can be resolved but they'll need to transfer me... that is how I spoke to the first three representatives. Overall, great products - a little pricey, terrible and complicated support."
cie_B	Bob Newhall	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	5	Tried other phone but for me Apple are the best.
cie_B	NonStopRobotDisco	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	3	Apple products are overly pricey, and far from perfect, but are still pretty reliable, which is reasonably admirable from a modern tech company. Their website is also straightforward to use, and provides a lot of useful product information. After-sales service has, however, declined with fewer staff to help in stores, and a more complicated online chat system. The chat service is also often unable to resolve my technical queries, resulting in me being referred to a phone service, which isn’t as convenient.The syncing of photos, to all of Apple devices, is what currently keeps me loyal to Apple, but I would be open to another, less costly, brand of and when they offer similar technology.
cie_B	Delandra Brokaw	2018-09-01T22:00:00Z	1	"My iPhone was in great condition, had only had it a few months when the battery stopped charging and died, my phone had not backed up before this and all of my vacation pictures were still on it.  I took it to Apple and waited over 2hours for them to ""diagnose"" that there was ""something wrong with the phone other than the battery so even if they put a new battery in it wouldn't work"".  They told me they couldn't do anything about the data on the phone and gave me a card for a company across the country that charges $700 for that at minimum.  I took it to a local store where I paid only $32 for labor and they were not only able to get the phone turned on, but they were able to back up all of my data to iCloud and told me that the only thing wrong with the phone was the charging port.  Apple was useless and wasted over two hours of my time.  Their product is the one that failed and they have people who can't even diagnose what is wrong with it correctly let alone help a customer get their data back.  Useless."
cie_B	Kia Grasty	2018-09-01T22:00:00Z	1	The Apple store at Ardmore Pa does not inform customers that prior to data back up. all data must be turned on. They brisk you through everything and rush you out of the store if you are there for simple issues. Only customers spending large money have their full attention This is unacceptable and should never happenAssociates should have sensitivety and inform customers that text messages etc etc could be lost prior to updates

cie_B	Bernadine Swanzy	2018-09-01T22:00:00Z	1	"The Apple Give Back program is using Brightstar to recycle IPads  Although I have UPS confirmation of delivery on 7/27, BrightStar has no record.   Apple can't do anything....even though they are responsible for sending the IPAD to Brightstar......I asked for $45 credit but ""they don't do that""   I feel that Apple can afford to give me a new IPad ....."
cie_B	Jack Swanzy	2018-09-01T22:00:00Z	1	Apple sent me an email advertising their GiveBack program. I followed instructions and mailed in my iPad to their agent, Brightstar. When I complained to Apple that I didn't receive a credit for my device, I got the run around. Apple said it had no responsibility for the loss of my device. Why does Apple treat a loyal customer so poorly? It's enough to move on to a better company.
cie_B	Phil Gottes	2018-08-31T22:00:00Z	1	I have had Apple phones for over 30 years but now I really know they are Fnnnnn scum bags!!!!! my SERI stopped working and no one not even Apple can fix this so I have to now pay a $200 Ins replacement fee. F YOU APPLE THIS IS MY LAST PHONE I WILL EVERY BUY FROM THIS GREEDY MONEY HUNGRY POS COMPANY!!!!!
cie_B	Roxana Andreea	2018-08-31T22:00:00Z	3	Yesterday I bought an iphone 8. I got home and tried turning it on but no response. Went to the store today and i got told they have to send it away for further checking so i have to wait another 5 days to get a phone i worked for a whole month. Thanks for nothing.
cie_B	mark	2018-08-30T22:00:00Z	1	Ordered a macbook pro, they used UPS which are terrible for informing customer when items are going to arrive.The MacBook Pro speakers are badly distorted when music is played on laptop, their support is absolutely useless.They told me to do the usual things such as reset pram etc. This computer is two (2) days old and is rubbish. How can they send something which does not work as sold and offer rubbish support.Mac again - NO WAY apple are screwed if they treat customers in this way.
cie_B	Daniel Claudio	2018-08-29T22:00:00Z	1	I have been a Apple iPhone customer forever. I have been using apple services and iTunes< iTunes Music forever - UNTIL one day my password for iTunes stopped working. after requesting a account recovery 5 times with no luck I called about for help- was told there was nothing that they can do about it that it was all up to me to resolve. WHAT??? THE ??? F? If you ever had to request your password in recovery it takes weeks before they send you a link VIA cell text or phone call. I tried this 5 time but never go a response back from apple- now mind you for 5 months they are still charging me my premiums for services I no longer have access to- Robbery I assure you. I will be talking to my lawyer as well. needless to say I will be cancelling my credit card they have on file which is BS but necessary in order to stop charges as the only way to cancel payment is by login to iTunes..... going to Verizon today for a nice upgrade to Android...… Apple lost a lifetime customer
cie_B	Jazz Kaur	2018-08-29T22:00:00Z	1	Purchasing a new iPhone 7 directly from Apple - firstly the issue with phones system crashed and was replaced by a refurb recycled bits/phone (not new retail boxed) and that's where my problems started. The screen protector purchased at Apple - bobbles within 24/48 hrs of it being fitted by Apple machine. The Milton Keynes Store - has swapped the phone 3 times and 6/7 protectors - 2 of the phones were at fault on the actual phone display faulty (why change two of them if the product is fine!!!!) Apple will not take responsibility as they changed it and constantly saying the phone are fine, hence why has the phone been changed so many times which amazes even with the evidence. Store directed to me to Customer Services and I am directed to Head Office taking more of time, been told to write a letter when it's on the system. This is very frustrating, eels like I am being pushed pillar to post making harder for the customer - when I have supplied photo evidence, my time spent as I run my own business. It's the first I have purchased my iPhone direct through Apple and purchased Apple Care too spending nearly £1000. Apple brand lacks the care of there customers when it comes to issues, after care service, very disappointing as I would not expect this from a Global Brand. Advising at store the General Manager does not meet people, phone has been changed 3 times apparently the product is not at fault!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cie_B	James Morrissette	2018-08-28T22:00:00Z	1	I am absolutely disgusted with the terrible experience I am having with Apple.  The company has completely gone to crap since Steve Jobs has passed.  TERRIBLE customer service.  TERRIBLE products.  I was an Apple man and I now will NEVER buy their products again.  I was going to buy a $5,000.00 computer with them and now I am going to go elsewhere.  I cannot suggest buying their phones, their Lap Tops or even their desk tops.  I have had problems with the I8, the X, the IMAC and more.  I spent 5 hours on the phone getting customer service to service and get my brand new IMAC running that I paid $3,000.00 for!  It was riddled with problems.  I literally gave up and had them return my money.  The knowledge of their products is gone. the quality is gone and the service is nothing short of pathetic.  My order number is W501475946 if they want to reach out and apologize.  This is the only thing I would accept at this time.  My X is a joke and I will be returning to Android.  I had 3 dropped calls while I was on the phone trying to get my computer working.I am the president of a manufacturing company and was going to upgrade my computer to a 5500.00 computer but I could not even get a manager on the phone to make it happen.  I was talking about changing over to MAC.  Now I will never do it.  It would bankrupt my company.They need to know I was on the phone for hours!
cie_B	Conor Dunne	2018-08-27T22:00:00Z	5	My family and I love Apple. We always buy our phones from them and whenever we have had a problem the customer service has been very supportive. The website is sleek and modern and the Apple Stores are clean and secure, with plenty of staff ready to help out. The prices of the phones are high, especially with the iPhone X - £1000? Really?! But the quality of the phones and the abundance of features make up for the high cost. The IOS interface, I believe, is 100 times better than the Android interface and is less confusing. Apple phones have always been strong and reliable in my opinion. iPads are like iPhones, just with a larger screen. MacBooks are excellent laptops that use the IOS operating system instead of Windows and I love it. Everything is in front of you and the interface is easy to navigate. However, like the iPhones, the MacBooks are very expensive. Overall, I recommend Apple products to all members of the family if they’re willing to spend a three or even four figure sum on a phone and another four figure sum on a laptop.
cie_B	david m	2018-08-26T22:00:00Z	5	Online Store RecommendedLike most reviewers, I'm usually on here to slag-off bad companies and counter the millions they spend on advertising, versus peanuts spent on Customer Services.However, I do order quite a few Apple products, mainly online and I have to say the website is clear and easy to navigate, even for bespoke special order / upgrades. All the products have arrived very quickly and very well packaged.Hard to fault. I hope I haven't jinxed myself and now they let me down!
cie_B	Max Baier	2018-08-26T22:00:00Z	1	I got stuck 7 hours with their idiotic german vendorsite support. It was about a 50€ mouse which made it impossible to use my 3500€ computer that isnt old yet. Neither the less they made it that I had to wait 6 hours until the store closed and i didnt get anything fixed. 3 days later they called me to  trying to tell me that it was my fault.  (Actually a manager wanted to review the case, which he didnt do)
cie_B	Kristen	2018-08-26T22:00:00Z	1	If I could give zero stars I would. I’m not even finished paying for my iPhone 7 Plus and the speakers stopped working. I spent my entire day traveling around trying to find someone to look at it and after restoring it was told this is a problem with a lot of this particular phone but since I had it just over a year it is not covered by any warranty. This was an 800 dollar phone. So, I call Apple and speak to a senior account manager after spending an hour on the phone for him to tell me there is nothing he can do to help me. It’s garbage! They could have done something. I have always used Apple products but no more.
cie_B	Stacey	2018-08-25T22:00:00Z	1	"The only reason I'm giving 1-star is because I can't give zero!My husband's iPhone 6s Plus stopped charging completely out of nowhere the other day - we've had it for a year in June. When I went to the Apple store, they did diagnostic testing and determined that the phone would never have enough power to turn on again, but didn't know exactly why (which I have an e-mail stating that). I was told the only thing they could do was offer me a brand new replacement for $500 dollars!! I fought against it stating it was a product malfunction and was not my fault - especially considering they couldn't properly diagnose why it happened! I was given no other choice. I tried calling Apple and was given the worst costumer service telling me the same bogus story that in-store provided me with. Basically, I had no other choice but to purchase another phone. When I was at the checkout, I had my non-functioning phone taken from me and placed into the package and when asked why they were taking it, I was told that it was policy that they had to take my old phone back which is why I was receiving a new one at a ""discounted"" price. They wouldn't even let me have my phone to back it up! I refused to give them the phone I PAID for and PAY again for another phone so I took my old phone home and contacted a friend with phone-tech experience. Let's just say that within 3 hours, he had my phone up and running!! AFTER BEING TOLD IT WOULD NEVER TURN ON AGAIN BY APPLE!Moral of the story - Apple very clearly is making customers buy new phones after telling them their phones are not fixable so that they can take the old phone, fix it and resell to make double the money!! No wonder the company is worth almost 1 trillion dollars!! RIDICULOUS!"

Now holding again on chat (100621560245) because I can't return my second Apple watch that had a battery explode the front screen without contacting Apple and waiting on hold.  Horrible experience on a horrible product!"

cie_B	Landlord	2018-08-21T22:00:00Z	5	great product and great customer service. Recently my Ipad cracked really badly they managed to get the ipad repaired in a matter of days, Really appreciate the response from the team.
cie_B	jason millar	2018-08-21T22:00:00Z	1	All their products iPads phones are not fit for purpose. The units are supposed to be portable that means moving them round. With moving them the risk of hitting something or dropping them comes into play. They have a thin layer of glass which means they are simply not fit for purpose. The apple spell check is a joke and makes up words puts the wrong words in sentences and makes you look neanderthol I won’t buy anymore of their expensive junk
cie_B	Hannah Henderson	2018-08-20T22:00:00Z	2	TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I Ordered a MacBook Pro recently with the educational promotion through Apple for school this semester. The system processed half of my order and not the other so I wasn't going to receive my product. I went through hours of customer service calls (which were a nightmare). They would put me on hold for 20+ minutes at a time and still not answer any of my questions. I was then passed around to many different people, none of which could help me fix the problem. They would try to send me back to previous people I had spoken with and then provide me with invalid extensions just to get me off the line. Even a week after my refund and product cancelation from the system, they still couldn't figure out how to let me order my MacBook. When I finally got it ordered under someone else's Apple ID, I paid more for the express shipping so that I would get in within the next couple of days for school and they didn't even respect that request. They didn't ship my order until after the date I originally paid for it to arrive at my house. I then had to go through more calls, transfers and holds to get a refund on the extra I paid for my shipping. I had originally attempted to purchase my MacBook a couple of weeks before school started but did not end up receiving it until a couple weeks into the semester. Completely ridiculous. Products are good but my recent experience with Apple customer service was awful. 10/10 would never recommend.
cie_B	James J	2018-08-20T22:00:00Z	5	i love the way that Apple products integrate seamlessly - watch, mac, phone... it makes life so easy. I have also had issues with broken phones where they have taken it in for a discount on a new replacement. Tech support have been great, software rarely crashes in comparison with other systems.. all in all, i feel like apple are a company that add value to my life by making everything easy and beautiful.
cie_B	Ivor Twydell	2018-08-19T22:00:00Z	1	I bought an iMac in late 2015 that in late March this year - 2018 - would not switch on. Took it to Apple in Bristol. They replaced the power supply unit and charged me £160. In July this year - less than 4 months later - the same problem occurred. This time I took it to an authorised dealer in Exeter (as it was much quicker to get an appointment with them than Bristol). They diagnosed the same issue. They asked Apple to cover the cost and Apple said no. The dealer - Stormwatch - advised me to take it up personally with Apple. However, as this was going to take time to do and I urgently needed the machine back for work, I asked them to go ahead and repair and I paid them for this. I then contacted Apple who agreed to cover the cost of the repair (in their language they said they would 'authorise an exemption'). Two days later I was asked to collect the repaired machine and expected a refund, however, on arrival was told that Apple would only cover the cost if Stormfront REMOVED the part they had just fitted and REPLACED with another part from Apple. This would have meant a wasted journey and another 5 day delay. They advised me to take it up with Apple. I collected the iMac and have since taken it up with Apple. They at first admitted that they would bare the cost but then changed tack and said that as I had paid Stormfront it is up to them to make a refund. No apology or recognisance that they either fitted a defective part or did not repair to correctly in March, no taking responsibility to put this right when it would be so simple to do so. I've been a long term Apple user however I've come to the view that even though they are an incredibly rich company they actually don't really care about customers and have no idea about customer service. Just because the individuals that front up the Apple customer interface are nice young men and woman doesnt mean it is good customer care. Really, really disappointed

Turned up at 09:30 on the Sat morning to be first in the queue. Bingo. Got in store only to be told (a little too gleefully) that the next collection slot was 2pm. With no other option, I had to hang around (Westfield) for four painful hours. So I go back in at 13.58 and the snarky, slimy, American guy tells me ""You do realise you are early?"". I mean, what a waste of space. Once told to take a seat, I had to wait until 14.40. Very unimpressed."
cie_B	Renny Hammond	2018-08-17T22:00:00Z	1	My iPhone 6 recently stopped working so I arranged a repair through Apple. I was told the maximum repair cost would be £306 BUT I would be contacted once they’d assessed the phone to confirm the actual cost. Within a few days they sent me an invoice for £306 and was told that’s what I would be charged. As an aside, two years ago I took my phone for a swim ( !) and the cost of repair was £65, very reasonable. I called to complain that I hadn’t been given the option of no repair as promised but was basically told ‘tough’. I spoke to the ‘most senior man you can speak to at Apple’ (!) and he told me he could do nothing about it but feedback to the original handlers manager. He couldn’t even listen to the original call to verify the information I was given was incorrect! Utterly useless. Apple do not care about their customers. Why should they when they’re the richest company in the world?UPDATE: 04/09/18. I have not received my phone back. It has been ‘lost in transit’ and Apple are sending me another. Even this has been badly handled. The person who is dealing with the case rarely contacts me despite me sending emails and although he gave me his direct line I have never got through to him. I have to chase all the time. We’ll see if I receive this phone.

cie_B	DEBBIE WILSON	2018-08-14T22:00:00Z	1	"One year ago I bought my I-phone through my provider Thumb Cellular. They set everything up for me, as i'm a senior citizen and not very good with technology. With all the passwords a person has to keep, and being older my family encouraged me to put them in my phone. Now to the phone problem. On August 8th 2018 I was on a group text and all of a sudden my phone went crazy. I took it to my provider on August 9th 2018. Because my passwords are in my phone they had to start account recovery. Well that went fine until they asked for my Credit Card numbers. It seems that the credit card associated with my account had expired. It would not accept the new one even though the account number was the same. Apparently you had to have the old expiration date and the old three digit number. When is the last time anyone kept their old expired credit card, because they might need it for their Apple account. So fast forward one week to August 15th phone not fixed because no apple password. Received an email on Friday August 10th, stating that I would receive a call from Apple on August 23rd at 12:28 pm to reset my password. Now I do understand having security measures, but as I told the representatives I spoke with at Apple today, once I was verified from Thumb Cellular, and through the apple email as the owner of the account, they should have sent a password reset right away. It sounds so stupid the reason for not sending it now. I ask everyone at Apple who reads this to look at their policy . Imagine if your mate collapsed in Cardiac Arrest, and I being a nurse said, "" well we really don't know if that is Joe, but we will start CPR on August 23 at 12:28pm. You scream no I need you to start it now!""  You yell ""no call 911 for an ambulance,"" and the dispatcher says, ""well really this is your fault, you should have left his name band from the hospital when he born, so that we would really know it was him.""  I learned two lessons do not buy an Apple Product, no information given on the important things that a person is to remember. The second lesson I learned is don't put passwords in your phone. The next thing is I doubt that anyone from Apple reads this and that they really don't care, because they are Apple and for TODAY they think that their company could never fail. Just a hint General Motors thought they were to big to fail too!"

I took it to the apple store and they said is nothing they can do. their only option all the time is get a new one really?. they  said the 1 yrs guarantee doesn't cover water damage. But this phone is not suppose to be water resistance? how come just with a rain just when bad?but no only that when I told the CSR in the store that my phone was getting super hot ( days before the rain) and turning off and on  he didn't care He just asked: How you will pay for your replacement? We can take credit card. Really that's all?  So that's  how apple  care about their customer ?  this is crazy.  so what is my option pay more money? for your crappy phone and your poor customer service.

I bought a new iPhone  7 because my old one is completely messed one won't come on. And I wanted to sign in with my old  Apple ID  to do that I need a verification code which s is either sent to my old phone(but can't access it) or texted to my number(which I've  changed so can't use that optuoj, I can't put my old sim  into the new one  I'll still need go past verification thing before i can access my text messages, so I tried to log in on my laptop to get the code but nooooo, even my laptop is asking for the stupid code, and saying If I can't use either options I should come back when I can! FFS! So my only option is to borrow a phone to put my old SIM, So long n inconvenient! Very miffed!Fix it pls!

Over the past few months, the silicone covering on the case has peeled off, the screen protector has cracked and bits of that have also peeled off. These two add-ons cost £65 in total and it seems to me they should last more than a few months. They both seem unfit for the purpose they were sold.Yesterday was the first opportunity I have had to take the phone to the Apple Store with the view to getting them replaced. I was astonished when the store assistant told me that Apple did not guarantee them. Furthermore he added if I should drop the phone and the screen cracked or it were to sustain any damage a replacement screen was over £200. Fear prevailed and I bought replacements thus shelling out an additional £65.Poor show Apple!!!! Looks like I have to factor in £130 per annum to protect crappy screens and substandard silicone cases.

I have bought 3 apple tvs, 3 apple watches, countless iphones, 6 ipads, even multiple ipods.  Geez apple you are so loyal to the customers that have made you the richest corporation in the history of mankind.

You'll pay a lot more because you'll need to find a ""licensed Apple rep"" and Apple is counter-intuitive when it comes to tech support, a small issue on a normal product is a big issue in an Apple product that will cost more and they'll likely throw out the bloody thing because Apple either makes things hard to diagnose/fix or it cost too much for them.The only reason to get an Apple product is if you have extra cash and willing to spend it on a product that simply looks better to you."

We bought an iMac from Apple online 7/16Order W589405707Serial C02X304MJ1G9Case ID 100600995249Didn't come on day of deliver/y 7/23. Why? Apple wrote the wrong address. We had to contact the shipping company and fix the problem and received 7/24- Apple did nothing expect apologize for the inconvenience.Following Tuesday 7/31 my wife goes to turn on the computer and it gives her a huge electrical jolt leaving her left arm numb for about 5 hours. We call customer service and say the computer is bad and that we want a replacement, customer service lies and says that isn't possible, so we say ""Fine pickup the computer and give us a refund"" CS again lies and says that isn't possible. That the computer can only be serviced.I check online to see if others have had the same problem and find refunds & repairs from Apple's own web site saying we can return our computer with 14 days of receiving (which it is/was).So we call CS again to find out why they lied - of course they wouldn't answer, just CS doesn't do refunds, just service. But we get the repair service cancelled and then are giving the Apple online store number and setup to return the computer. What happens, On 8/5 Apple calls and admits it screwed up again and sent the iMac into repairs. On 8/7 today, the iMac showed up in my garage. Apparently Apple isn't capable of sending a computer from their repairs division to their online store division.  We call CS to find out what's up. They say we have to call the online store again and set up another pickup because they can't do it. Is this really legally our responsibility? We sent the iMac to Apple using their print out address. Why do we have to deal with it again.Anyways, we call Online and now the new pickup is 8/9 and our refund won't be done until after 8/18 - after credit card is due, when we were initially told by 8/13 before credit card is due. So another headache in the making.I have to wonder is Apple really this incompetent or is it because my wife is Japanese and doesn't understand the legal system well?

cie_B	Man Nguyen Loan Le	2018-08-05T22:00:00Z	1	Dear customer service,I am writing this comment because I was very dissapointed about your products. I am a big fan of apple product, and i could not expect this would happen to me. I have been using apple product for 8 years and i love it. I purchased an iphone SE 2 years ago with payments. When I just completed the last payment in 1 month then the phone had big problem. I was charging the phone before going to sleep. The phone was updating by itself and got frozen with itune icon. I tried to call customer sevice to help me fix the iphone via phone. But problem could not be solved. After that, I bring the phone to apple store and the guy their told me its a hardware problem. I protect my phone in the huge shocked proof case with power and phone jack covered. I dont think it had a water damages as he said. I told him that is it worth if you buy a phone and its “dead” at the time when you pay off the phone?. And I was suprised with his answer as “ thats why people need to buy a new phone”. Is it how you guy treat customer? Should I expect the new $1000 iphone will last more than 2 years? And do i have to spend more than $1000 every year to buy an iphone. Is it how your invention  to make an iphone only last 2 years in order to sell more products? And last question, should I switch to android or keep trusting in your products?Thanks for your time to read me comment.
cie_B	Sofi Behlim	2018-08-02T22:00:00Z	1	I bought guy this phone brand new through my cell phone provider, T-mobile.  After doing the usual 2 year financing and paying off the phone, the phone suddenly started giving me major problems:The center button (home button) stopped working.  As one can imagine, not being able to use my home button made me not able to navigate through my apps, select my apps, seeing my home screen, etc. etc.  (sigh).  I had to find ways to use the side button to light up my phone and swipe left to select whatever recent apps I had used or search.  Sometimes the search worked, sometimes not.  The phone battery drains down for no reason.  I could have it fully charged before bed, not use the phone while sleeping, and by morning, it would be down to 3% battery.  Sometimes the phone would be hot at random times.  Of course, since I can’t use the home button, I’m unable to close apps.Using apps will sometimes just not work.  I can be safari browser surfing and all of a sudden, touching the screen or navigating does nothing.  Or the response will be delayed.I’m just very disappointed in Apple.  I find it very ironic that in the 2 years of having this phone, I haven’t had problems but coincidentally after the 2 years, I now am having these issues.  Multiple issues, that make it nearly impossible for a person to be able to use their phone with ease.Of course there is no warranty to cover this.  Anyone is pretty much SOL.  What a waste of money.I am 110% certain that this is a predicted issue that Apple has placed for consumers - because the average person chooses to finance their cell phone for 2 years as most companies offer.  Therefore, it makes sense for a company like Apple to generate issues on their products right after 2 years, in hopes that consumers will just go replace their products to a newer product and finance a $1,000 phone again.  Since they’re financing, why bother looking at the total cost?  It’s a $1,000 for a CELL phone.  In this case, $500 per year.  The funny thing is that it’s the people who don’t really have the money (like kids/teenagers or low income people) that are the first to want to blow money on another $1,000 cell phone.I am no longer buying any Apple products.  I think they are a greedy company that’s running a conspiracy business and I don’t trust their products.If you’re smart, you will not buy them either.  Go for anything else.

I had taken it to Apple 2 times and both times they couldn't fix the laptop. They expected me to take it to another place, play lots of cash and get it fixed as they did not have the tools to do so........ how does a MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR company not have the tools? This all seems so ridiculous. APPLE IS A SCAM. I will never lay my hands on another apple product again.

cie_B	Elle	2018-07-26T22:00:00Z	4	Dear Apple company,     This is a letter that hopefully would cross to your company. I would like to suggest that you make a phone with a chord to an ear piece plug and a charger as well. This is because, you should give the customer an option if they want a wireless earpiece or not. I love your product but very disappointed with this one plug charger and no earpiece old fashion separate plug. As a constumer, it would be nice to give us the option. I wanted to buy your brand but what discourages me is that there's no option for me to weather use my old fashion way earpiece or the wireless because honestly, although the world is so advance, there's my kind out there who likes the old fashion wired earpiece. I hope you will put back the earpiece plug in your next phone. I'm looking forward to your future inventions.
cie_B	Ronny Cramer	2018-07-26T22:00:00Z	2	The planned obsolescence of products by Apple is not immediately apparent from the first time you unbox one of their elegantly wrapped products. Products from them are constantly having issues with performance due to thermal limitations of their Macbook design, slowed iPhones due to the excuse of wanting to protect the battery life and lack of openness that creates a situation for consumers of purchasing Apple products as a necessity rather that choice. Although I do credit Apple for excellent advertising and integrations of their products, I can not forgive their lack of caring for real issues that they only seem to care about when the major news outlets start picking up on it.
cie_B	Ms BNM	2018-07-25T22:00:00Z	1	Apple bosses wake up as your problems may be your own upgrades …….!!!!!I have reported to apple many times. This year I had 3 Macs one after the other due to locking & defective factory setting, upgraded to factory setting my self many times in the beginning, apple store installed new operating system 3 times & many chats but I am still pointing finger at apple upgrades as my Mac keep getting affected.Someone is playing “cat & mouse” game where I am the “mouse”. It works then blocked but unable to remain unblocked. Trustpilot is not immune. I have sent them evidence as it has become nightmare to put reviews.Here is my evidence Since last new operating system installed by apple store nothing was installed , as wrote earlier having problem with emails & so forth. I started to avoid Apple upgrades but now thought will do & also installed virus protection. After activating upgrade from apple store my computer shut down,  With computer shut down upgrading took place, then it did not switch back,  I have to restart  when pop  password came, after that security fire/vault poped up & gave 2 choices to iCloud  to remember password or  key numbers. I picked code. Pop up flashed key numbers which did not give me time to write but disappeared. Nothing else popped up to activate. I have written before I found my iCloud key numbers were listed  previously . Apple claims it does not remember iCloud  password so how come my numbers were listed in my MAC. This time numbers are flashed for others to copy but not for me to use. My files are now only can be saved in iCloud & download.Apple must explain how their own upgrade from the apple store has infected my computer once again &  not for my benefit.Another example:After much struggle I was going to publish Thames Water Trustpilot review. I kept pressing button to submit but window remain. I presumed unable to submit.  Then pop up came informing that it will take time to publish & will be notified by email. After I close the Trustpilot window to submit review, underneath there was Trustpilot window already published review with time. It is clear from above example that window informing me it will publish later was from the hacker.My email work & then blocked, worked again along with other issues too  even pages.My Bitdefender & malware remover says computer is clean.APPLE BOSSES YOU NEED TO FIRE THE STAFF WHO ARE CREATING BUGS & VIRUS BY DEFAULT  . ONLY WAY YOU WILL RESTORE YOUR REPUTATION BY INVESTING YOUR VAST FORTUNE ON YOUR OWN FACTORY TO MAKE IT VIRUS FREE WITH HONEST WORKERS. SPEND SOME MONEY ON YOUR SUPPORT TEAM SO THEY ARE UP TO DATE WITH THE SYSTEM & GIVING CORRECT INFORMATION & SUPPORT.

My apple authorised charging lightening cable snapped inside th charging port and they said they couldn’t fix it. What I can’t understand is it was thier product that broke inside another of thier product but they accept no fault. They then want to charge me for the privillage by charging me for a new iPad. They have done me a favour with thier arrogance as I have decided to ditch them. I have been with them for 14 years since one of the first iPods. Treat your customers right and they will stay loyal.

I have been an avid consumer of apple.Now i feel cheated. their online support is horrendous, unknowledgable and con like when it comes to being clear upfront about cost or repairs even if you pay for coverage. Go to an apple store and try your bets there but thats not the best when your apple store is not convenient for travel , why dont you have a click and collect service for london!
cie_B	Chad	2018-07-20T22:00:00Z	1	Don't waste your time supporting Apple anymore. Their customer services is such trash now.  I went to return the hot potato that is the i9. After many test and even results I duplicated for employees. All upper management was reluctant to help me at all. I didn't once yell or treat anyone disrespectfully even though they are lying about the new i9 line. I simply wanted an exchange for the i7 version so I didnt waste my money for gains not there. At first employee helping me made this seem like an easy situation. After about 30 minutes of trying to figure out the exchange. I was told I couldn't do an exchange because they cant put more than 2000 dollars on a gift card, and can't use two gift cards per transaction. Which honestly seems like a blatant lie. I just dont think they wanted to work. The only option they would give me is a refund. Then I could repurchase the mac.. Keep in mind this is a 4000 dollar machine. I actually could float the transaction and wanted to do this, but I had $1500 dollars financing from Apple on this purchase that I still wanted to use.. NOPE they couldn't use the $1500 dollars I had already spent via their FINANCE program... So my only option is to wait 2 weeks for the refund and then orde rit again, wait another month for the custom backordered 32gb macbook pro... Well I just purchased a Windows 6-core laptop... Screw you Apple.  I could not believe they wouldn't do anything. After 2 hours... They refunded me the laptop didn't give me anything for the Crap show they displayed/nor the crap show of hardware they just released.  If you are going to get new mbp.. Get i7, but  I suggest waiting until apple gets their crap together better. I also think this store could of helped me but chose not too.. Which is just sad.

cie_B	Nadun Kuruppu	2018-07-15T22:00:00Z	1	I have an apple ipad mini which was bought in 2013 brand new and had been using it ever since then without any problems. Apple was brand I use to trust always as I use other apple products too and I thought the safety was trust-able.Roughly about 2 months back, I had put the ipad on the charger and it was plugged for about 30 minutes or so and was shocked to come back to a burning hot ipad. It was literally burning hot and I couldn't touch it. I straight away removed it from the charger as I thought it will explode and i had seen how Samsung products and even some apple devices had exploded whilst they were charging and was scared as even my little one sometimes uses the ipad.I let it to cool down and tried to switch it back on but it did not do anything at all. Once it was totally cool down I plugged again to see if it was charging and the ipad did not give any response so I decided to contact the customer service where they asked me to reset and connect it to a computer but none showed any activity on the ipad, therefore they booked an appointment for myself at an apple store.I went to the appointment and the staff connected the iPad to one of their chargers and said it should switch back in 15 minutes. But the ipad did not switch on at all and the staff said, that they can swap an ipad for the price of £165. I was like what?? There is a safety issue with this ipad and this could have been exploded if i didn't check and take it off the charger when it was burning hot, so why do i need to pay for a faulty or an ipad that develops safety concerns.I had been then told by the staff to wait till she speaks with her manager and she came back with another alternative to pay £85 instead just for the battery and they will swap it.I do not think they really car for people and they safety as they all want is to recover or earn some money out of every issue.Really disappointed with the product and mostly the service I received.Would not recommend buying the apple products as I strongly believe safety issues like this should be handled and dealt with more responsibly as they are playing with people's lives.

She din't document the call, so I called up and this time another agent tried to help me. I was more interested to escalate such humiliating behavior, and guess what...APPLE DOES NOT HAVE ANY ESCALATION MATRIX. BS. Absolutely BS. good product has to be backed up by great service. All of these goes hand in hand to provide a great ongoing customer experience. Apple has truely become a downmarket product. I just bought the product, and I regret it

I keep calling them and they don’t give me a straight answer. The customer service I have received on this matter is pattetic. I hope someone from Apple is reading this.

cie_B	Jon	2018-07-09T22:00:00Z	1	My iPhone 7 used to always ask for me to back up my storage and I always did. It always bothered me about photo sharing and other things to keep my stuff. My phone finally died for whatever reason and now I have none of my photos, no backups, even though it said I had backed it up numerous times after this complete trash can of a device asked me a million times to. Now I Have lost 4000 photos, years of memories that I will never ever get back. Absolutely ridiculous how they can craft new phones and hardly improve their tech but they still can't fix the smallest things for back up if anything goes wrong with any of their trash devices. Worst phone company ever, get a phone somewhere else. Anywhere but this trash company

This product, when I bought it, was misleading, there are photographs that I cannot retrieve from anywhere else and are unretrievable from this product! I will never buy an i pod or iPhone or I anything from Apple again.
cie_B	Edwin	2018-07-08T22:00:00Z	1	Can no longer schedule a repair appointment in advance, and because I want to get a device repaired when I revisit the US, that makes things difficult.  When I arrive, there will be no convenient appointments if any, and Apple Stores are sparce.Apple must improve Apple Care outside the US.
cie_B	Aishling Grimes	2018-07-07T22:00:00Z	5	So my iphone 7 literally just broke down ju to a glitch with the mechanices on the phone not allowing me to get a GPS signal . I was speaking to Hermenia online and honestly every possible little thing that could have been done was and she quickly organised for my phone to be collected for repairs and ensured me that everything will be done in a timely fashion and that I can track the progress online too . She was so reassuring and nice to deal with and made this much less difficult then it had initially seemed.

My  phone has been in shop since June 21  for the 9th problem I have had with I phone 7 plus and was told it would take 7 to 10 days well guess what I still do not have my phone and they do not  have enough concern to figure out a way for me to get a phone to use unitl they can finally get my phone back to me after I told them on June 21 that I use my phone for my busy so two weeks I have lost business and Had to go back add my samsung phone to have a phone to use this is unexceptable and ridiculous I hate they day I switched from my samsung to this piece of crap for better words apple phone but you best believe when I get it back I am going back to Samsung never had these issues APPLE SUCKS and good luck to whoever use this product it died when the original owner died.  These product are overpriced for the type of customer service you get.Dee Dee Wardlaw
cie_B	John Burghorn	2018-07-03T22:00:00Z	1	I have a lot of health issues so wasn't able to make an appointment due to Dr's appointments of uncertain length.  I live 65 miles away from store so didn't want to make special trip.  I went to the Apple store in Des Moines Iowa with a MacBook Pro less then 10 months old.  The charger didn't work.  I was told it would take 2 1/2 hours to see someone in product support and after signing up I started receiving stupid texts.  Finally I got one telling me to return to the store.  I checked in with one of their employees who told me to go sit in a specific area.  I sat there for an hour and when I checked with another employee I was told since I didn't show up I lost my slot.  Then I lost my temper.  One of the store managers noticed my disgust and came over and got me to a more private area.  He was a nice guy (name was Tony) but I still needed to wait another 45 minutes.  I am not at all surprised Apple doesn't have a public site to review their miserable practices.  I will not be an Apple customer much longer.  Life is too short to waste on a company who doesn't care about their customers.

cie_B	P Dalton	2018-06-30T22:00:00Z	1	"I have attempted to 'redeem' an Apple Gift Card for £15. It proved faulty and would not respond. During various email contact attempts Apple support has given me conflicting assurances and avoided answering my direct questions about their obvious and convenient assumptions and contradictions. Because of this I have asked for the matter to be raised at a higher level (promised by support) only to be fobbed off by somenone (no surname) who claims to be a 'managerial representative' and seeks entirely to evade giving me any useful reply except the Apple equivalent of 'go away we do not pay'.I cannot view this in any other way but (1) as a deliberate deceit and (2) a refusal to face a duty of care towards clients and their purchases made in good faith and in the expectation of an honestly observed consumer rights process.In this case they seek to (3) put the onus on me, for not having a receipt for a gift despite receiving from me the adequate explanation which they required.(4) put the onus on the vendor, who ""may not"" have activated the card, when they cannot disprove that (an assertion, e.g. ""may not  have"". is not proof) the card was faulty in the first place.(5) remove the onus from themselves by ignoring my questions about the reliability of the machines installed (by Apple ?) for processing the cards at purchase in the first place - again no satisfactory reply.I would like Apple to make a simple refund of the Gift Card face value of £15 sterling which Support assured me could be done. I would like to see assurance for all Apple customers that refusing to recognise a valid and honest claim is not part of the Apple business ethic and that they do recognise their duty of care towards clients and recognise consumer rights. ."

cie_B	Yasmine Sebti	2018-06-26T22:00:00Z	1	I am disheartened to see that, if we own an iphone 6 or older device, we are completely left behind, at the expense of becoming new i phone customers. This planned obsolescence should be brought to light again and attented to. We can’t just keep following Apple blindly, we are no sheeps! Six months ago, my phone shut off  and wouldn’t turn back on. After examination, a technician at the Apple genius bar in Paris told me that this was  a hardware problem from Apple, and that they would offer me to buy a new  iphone 6 for 350€ .I was gullible enough (and still hopeful about the the company’s customer service policy) and decided to go for this solution. Little did i know, the said “new” phone started to shut down randomnly, freeze and show the wrong time of day after one month of use and the new ios update. A week ago, I have gone to the genius bar again to be sent out with this message verbatim: “ I am sorry madam, we see that there was nothing wrong about the usage of your new phone, it is just that our new softwares affect the older generation phones in a way that they don’t work as well as they used to. The only solution would be to buy another phone for 350€ or upgrade to the new iphone.”I am disgusted by this capitalist,oportunistic and totally backward strategy. Relying on the 5% population who is star struck by your designs is not a sustainable way to lead the future of technology. I am truly desapointed Apple, by your endeavour toward planned obsolescence, your absolute disdain for your 95% other long term consumers who have been buying your first  iphones, ipads and ipods, and would otherwise have the potential to become ambassadors to your brand. Shame on you.

It took a few days of visits to Manchester arndale and a few calls from their Irish based support team. However, one guy called Andy at the store in the arndale was so helpful I can’t thank him enough. He really savoured my experience with apple. Apple .... you need need to employ more Andy’s.

Tried to get refund or new watch. It took over 10 days of sending watch back, asking over 3 technicians and all they say is that there is point of impact ( the watch was dropped or something dropped on it). I did not dropp it at all. The screen is very soft and does not last long. They asked me for 188£+TAX to repair it. This multibillionare company does not give a damn hell nothing about their customers. They see money, nothing else. Just wasted 359£ within 3 days. Please think twice whether you spend money on nothing or you enjoy it better.
cie_B	Elizabeth Gray	2018-06-21T22:00:00Z	2	"Apple doesn't have a way to review their products on their site.  Why would a company not allow you to review their products???  I have had more issues with Apple products over the past 18 months than I have in the 25 years I have owned Apple products.  The iPhone SE is awful, just plane awful.  Can not believe they are still selling it.   The Apple watch series 3 as a fitness tracker is subpar.  To earn exercise minutes to fill the ""ring"" you have to walk, even in the workout app, a 18 min. mile pace.  That is a fast walk.  Apples manual says brisk walk.  Brisk walk is different for different people in different health conditions.  There are people if they walked that fast it could cause physical harm.  So when you can not fill your exercise ring even if you are out walking for 30 min.  I would assume you would get frustrated and many people would give up working out because it doesn't matter.  Apple has some serious things to update and change.  The people at Apple support are not aware of this pre-set pace.  It took me two watches, a new phone and more hours on the phone with Apple support than I care to count before someone told me about this Apple set pace.  Very disappointed in Apple.  They seem to be focused on bells an whistles and not good solid products."
cie_B	Robert Murray	2018-06-21T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely appalling customer service. I have apple Iphone 7. I noticed that when I put my phone on charge it heats up and the and set gets really hot. I went to pick my phone up when it had been charging for half an hour and was so hot that I dropped it. I have an expensive screen protector on it but still there was a crack going along the screen form where it landed on the carpeted floor. I went into apple store after making appointment to get it looked at and was told it was overheating due to the fact it was charging at a high rate higher than the average and to contact customer support about the warranty and replacement phone because the phone had a physical fault with the heating problem. I contacted apple support and was told they would speak to engineers and get back to me. Weeks had passed and after numerous emails and phone calls finally got a call back from a different person than I spoke with before and they just said engineers did tests and there is nothing wrong with my handset, curious because they have never seen my handset as they had not requested me to send it to them so how they know my phone is fine is a mystery and how their report said different to the report of the engineers in their shop who had actually examined my phone. This guy proceeded to say this case is closed and if you want you can book in local store for repair or replacement. He was so rude, arrogant and then as I requested a copy of the report of his engineers so I can compare with the one I got from the store he just kept repeating the fact case is closed. I have heard and seen stories of apple's poor customer service but I have been with their products since the beginning and have never had a problem with their phones, ipods or watches and all of my stuff is protected and never better condition but then as soon as I have a fault and dropped because of this fault, what do I have to do let the phone burn my hand and then take law suit to them or my home burn down. The guy over the phone even said it could be a software problem, I was like okay so either there is physical fault or software fault, either way I should be entitled to a replacement on those grounds and because I am still within my warranty

I have had several films disappear and apple can’t even refund me or replace the items. Disgusted with the service I have received and won’t be spending another penny with them. If I bought a PlayStation 4 from pc world for example it’s pc worlds responsibility to replace it if it’s faulty not Sony so why is Apple refusing to refund me. Will be purchasing blue rays and dvds from now on and changing my phone and iPad. So long Apple
cie_B	Jo Lawler	2018-06-18T22:00:00Z	2	I paid for my ex-partners Apple Music subscription on my credit card, when we split up I contacted Apple to cancel the subscription. I was told that I needed an Apple ID or access to the iPhone to be able to cancel.I explained that my ex-partner and I no longer together so I don't have any way of getting this info. I asked could they not search for the account from my name and credit card number?No they are unable to do that, because of data protection rules. So I was left in a state of either having to contact my ex to get him to phone to cancel it, continue to pay Apple for a subscription I don't use or go the my bank and get them to stop the payment. I went for the latter in the end.

cie_B	- Aster1112 -	2018-06-08T22:00:00Z	1	I was playing Fortnite on the iPhone 8 Plus.  At the end of the game there was only two people me and another guy.  It was then that I was on top of the tower ready to snipe him.  Keep in mind I had one blue AR with scope and a gold sniper rifle.  Once again on top of the tower my shot lined up perfectly ready to shoot and then all the sudden Bam my phone screen is black. I Couldn’t believe it. I didnt know what happened.  It was then I realized that my phone had turned off due to low battery.  I was furious since I could’ve won that Fortnite game.  so Apple if you’re reading this please fix your batteries because I was barely on my phone all that day and I charge it to hundred percent the night before. TERRIABLE BATTERY LIFE.
cie_B	Smmms Webber	2018-06-08T22:00:00Z	1	I own an Apple MacBook Air 13. It developed a problem with the cooling fan requiring replacement. I went to the Annapolis Store and the MacMedic Store in Severna Park MD. Could not get prompt service at either location. They insisted on keeping the computer for several days to more than week in order to effect the simple repair. Given the sensitivity of the data maintained on my computer and the problem created by not having computer available for up to a week or more leaving the machine with them was not an option, Needed repair done while I waited. They would not not even consider coordinating an appointment to get the work done while I waited. This was a simple repair not requiring any extensive testing, analysis, or skill. In the end I ordered a fan based on the serial # and a set of tools (all for $27.00) and performed the repair in 30 minutes after watching a utube repair video. System works great now. Apple service sucks and acts like a cult. They are inflexible, bureacratic,arrogant, expensive, and ineffective. The Genius should be renamed the Moron bar. Would never consider purchasing any Apple product again given the average performance of the equipment, terrible service support, and much better alternatives available.

Apple have over complicated everything from deleting music to transfering data. Every time I have been passed up to a manager for simple tasks that should be drag drop or delete. On one occasion I got cut off from a manager who told me to swithch the phone off and he never phoned me back.For a manger this is not good enough and from Apple i expected better from a loyal customer . I wwnt into the shop today the phone is hissing when I make calls the guy told me a problem with the apps the phone needed to be restored from original I was told this was done.I walked out the shop used the phone problem was still there. What a shambles but looking at the reviews on trust pilot I wish I had bought a Android phone This will be my last apple phone the ammount of stress the phone has caused and it is still unusable .WORD CANT EXPLAIN HOW ANGRY i AM

cie_B	Ani	2018-05-28T22:00:00Z	1	I purchased a MacBook Pro and am allergic to whatever is in it's metal casing. Each proceeding Apple metal encased laptop design, has made my palms and wrists sting and itch more. It's hard to find a plastic encased computer, or a keyboard without any exterior metal, there isn't an option in the Apple line currently. Post production fixes don't cover all the metal components adequately, or are clumsy and move around.  It would be awesome if Apple created a smooth plastic interior snap on case, that covered the keyboard, palm rest, sides and exterior for those of us with metal allergies to chromium, nickel,  cobalt, etc. Or offered customers the ability to order plastic casing as a custom MacBook Pro option.
cie_B	Catpocalypse	2018-05-27T22:00:00Z	1	"Apple's products are just terrible. Really, everything you made recently, or updated completely sucks. First off, every single time you make a new iPhone, it just gets 1000x worse. iPhone 6 was doing ok, but then 7 was complete trash. The removal of the audio jack was the dumbest idea I've ever heard. The developer who got that idea needs to be fired. No one cares that you added more speakers. No audio jack means headphones require some stupid connector, they will often pop out of the phone when connected because the charger slot was never as strong as the audio jack slot, and you can't charge and listen to music at the same time. Oh my, I can't wait for 10. No more button, that's gonna be the most annoying thing in the universe. What's next? The removal of the screen?And it's not just your awful physical products that are terrible. Your apps are just as bad. Maybe even worse. iMovie is complete garbage. It is way too limited. You can't do anything with the trailers, they will always look the same and unprofessional. Someone's gonna see it and go, ""Oh, they made it in iMovie, that's cheap.""  You can't include any music of your own either, which is really annoying and lame. Making movies is quite useless as well. There really is nothing you can do with a movie but change the stupid lighting. iMovie is a big waste of time. I could do an entire movie in power point and it would look better.Don't even get me started with Garage band. That app is even worse than iMovie. First off, no one likes that metronome. You need to toss that piece of crap into the trash. It's obnoxious and does nothing but get in the way. The instruments are also garbage. You can barely play anything at all, and they sound fake and way off. Plugging in a real instrument is also a waste of time. Because you just take away all my good effects from my amp or pedals and replace them with your trashy ones. Recording is the most annoying thing in the world. Apple makes this nearly impossible. There needs to be no time limit at all to when you record. And the loops needs to start AUTOMATICALLY when you're ready to record it. It's common sense really. Something your company doesn't have.Honestly Apple, get your act together. Your products and all of your other crap just make you look bad. I would not recommend your garbage to ANYONE."
cie_B	Ladys Almaguer	2018-05-25T22:00:00Z	1	published review 5/26/18I went in today with a problem and apple wanted to give me another one instead. My iphone 7 plus does not connect to internet through wifi not data! The phone is cosmetically brand new and only had that issue! Which it is still under warranty ! They wanted to give me a loaner phone and take mine in for 10-12 days! You may say thats fine! But if something happens to that loaner phone even a single scratch you pay for it! They refuse to swap the phone under the warranty and even the costumer service supervisor refused as well! That he was the last resource and that was it! Apple is no longer the company that i started to use back in 2007! Where you had a problem and they will make it easier for you as a costumer! Now is like it nor not either you get screwed or you do! They dont care anymore! It was unreasonable for me to take a liability on a borrowed phone while they “fix” my phone that i had still under the warranty!

So I’m very upset n very turned off. So I’ll try to abstain from buying their products in the future n I recommend for others to do the exact same. What goes around comes back around

cie_B	Maria	2018-05-20T22:00:00Z	1	Just bought the new macbook 2017 in march, it came with a faulty video board, meaning the motherboard of the computer was damaged before i bought it.... they refused to change my computer before it was repaired (with parts that could be new or refurbished), they repaired it, a week passed and it presented the same problem again. Called apple support and they said they still wouldn't change it unless it went to repair again to try and see if it can be repaired... so it has been 3 months since i had my computer and i still have not had a chance to use it properly. This has been such an inconvenience since i bought the computer because i needed it for university, yet i have not had the chance to use it, had to go back to my old lenovo that has issues turning on.... worst 1300 dollars i have spent....

cie_B	Sébastían	2018-05-18T22:00:00Z	5	I have been using Apple products for over 25 years, and have been using Apple's service (iCloud, iTunes) and their online shop for more than 10 years. I never had a problem. All my Macs are still going strong, even a 10 year old MacBook and iPod. I like how all their online services are connected, it really saves me a lot of time when I swap between my MacBook Air, iMac and iPad Pro. I am on the road a lot, and having access to my files everywhere relaxes me.

I had shipped them an ipad that needed to be repaired under warranty because the battery took over 12 hours to charge and then the battery life would be depleted in only a couple of hours. This ipad was less than 1 year old. They determined that because it had ""accidental damage"" that was the fault for the defective battery and would not repair the device unless I paid them $249!! Now this accidental damage was 2 dents that were so small you have to angle the ipad to catch the lighting just right to see them. Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!! DO NOT BUY APPLE PRODUCTS!! They openly admit that they are at fault for defective batteries and their solution is to charge the customer to fix it. Will never buy an apple product again. Not a phone, computer, tablet, charger, headphones, NOTHING."

Left message for Senior Advisor on his DL but hasn’t he hasn’t returned my call so the pit of despair remains.It is quite a horrendous experience.The need for security is paramount but Apple is beyond obsessive verging on paranoia especially as there are several layers of security and I could pass any of them in a heartbeat, except the cell phone number.I volunteered to give my cell number to them but they couldn’t do this, go figure.A great shame as Apple has much going for it but this is not the first time I’ve found dealing with Apple a bureaucratic, onerous, unrewarding and massively frustrating experience.

cie_B	Cay	2018-05-16T22:00:00Z	1	The only reason I am giving the Apple store in COQUITLAM Center a single star is because the Genius spoke to me. However I felt I was treated with so little empathy and my cracked screen situation dismissed. Many of us buy iPhones despite the price because Apple used to stand behind their products. I had a feeling my iPhone6 Plus was not going to be a simple screen replacement because of the dent close to the home button. But the genius approached my problem with arrogance and no empathy for the $$$ I was about to lose because of my stupid mistake. They need training. They have no idea what their customer demographics/personna is and how to communicate with them. One company that provides excellent customer support is Jackrabbit technical whose clients would rather spend time teaching dance over running software but Jackrabbit support helps them. If the software doesn’t do it they bend over backwards to find a work around. No snobbery and down talk. I hate the Apple geniuses. If it wasn’t because my entire household runs on apple products, I would be boycotting them after today’s experience.They need to lower their up turned noses.

I spent 2 hours being thrown around and their only 2 solutions was to “turn the phone off and on” and do a master reset. Thanks for being useless as always Apple!

This all started after I did the latest update, even though I have turn off all background refreshes and basically put my phone in Low Power Mode.
cie_B	Iceman11	2018-05-14T22:00:00Z	1	I’m getting tired of apple, we have hundreds if not thousands of corporate Apple devices, getting an appointment even at one of the 3 Apple stores in London is painful. On occasion the telephone support advises to turn up early at the store with no appointment and That you will get seen to, that just doesn’t work, it then means hanging around for hours in the hope of a potential appointment. Yet more wasting of your time on advisement by Apple.The higher level of enterprise support, is like playing the lottery, it continues the Apple theme of extorting cash from you For a crappy inferior service.You would think with all the profits they are generating, they would spunk some of it into more support, it appears not.

cie_B	WenDee Lee	2018-05-09T22:00:00Z	1	I bought an iPhone through apple online.Due to the site not having a choice that said unlocked,I had to choose a carrier.In which I chose T-Mobile because that was the carrier I was using.Now when I tried to change my carrier to sprint,I was told the phone is not compatible with them although it is unlocked because the hardware on the phone is set for GSM only.If it was CDMA,then I would have been able to use it with Sprint.Due to the way Apple made the phone,which I had no idea they had 2 types of phone.My only choice is to either use T-Mobile or Att; or buy a new one so I could use at sprint.If there was information this important,apple should train all employees to inform the customer of their choices before they pay for it.nowhere on the phone or site states what phone type you bought, GSM or CDMA.Not even apple technicians can tell until they check the model of it, which u can only find in the area where the sim is pulled out of. Everyone, please pray that you have a CDMA one so you could use it at anyone of the 4 big US carriers. They will not do anything for you if your phone can not be used anymore once it is past the 14 day return policy. They already have the money, so why would they care right? They can even make more money, if you have no choice but to buy a new one so you could use it at the new carrier.
cie_B	Frank	2018-05-06T22:00:00Z	1	My son purchased a new IPhone6 from US Cellular a little over a year ago. After only one year the phone’s battery began draining significantly. We sent the iPhone in to get the battery replacement from Apple on April 20, 2018. We received an email from Apple on April 23, 2018 stating they received the product. On April 23, we received an additional email saying they would be unable to replace the battery because of ‘unauthorized modifications’. They stated that the only options were to pay $450, recycle my phone or send the phone back unrepaired, or contact Apple support. We called Apple support the same day to inquire what the modifications were. The first person we spoke to read the ‘technicians note’ stating they found ‘3rd party modifications’. We asked what 3rd party modifications they claimed to have found but they were unable to tell us. We ended up speaking to 4 different ‘senior advisors’. None of them were able to tell us what modifications were found, and they were unable to communicate with the ‘technicians’ and ‘engineering department’ at Apple in order to find out. We spoke to Bryan, a senior advisor, on the 24th and he said to give him 2 days and he would get information as to why the technicians won’t replace the battery. He called back on April 26 and had NO information for us. This was 2 more days wasted. He said he was unable to contact the technicians. He advised us to speak with one of the ‘senior advisors’ that we had spoken to before. At this point we’re going in circles. When we demanded that they escalate the issue, he referred us to Cassandra, a ‘senior customer relations’ representative. After again being on hold for a lengthy period of time, Cassandra said she was looking over the case notes. She said the carrier was AT&T. Which is false. It’s US Cellular, which she should have had in her notes, because we told the first Senior Advisor we talked to on April 23rd that our carrier was US Cellular. Also in my conversation with Bryan, we had specifically stated the name of the carrier.  So clearly, there is a lack of communication between the departments. Cassandra then asked about the $450 to replace my phone. SO we AGAIN asked to speak with a manager or supervisor. She then connected us to Robert.Once again, in another futile conversation, and still left with the lingering question as to what were the 3rd party modifications. To resolve the issue, Robert wanted to send my phone to an Apple store.  He stated that at an Apple store, a person would actually be able to look at my phone. Which is extremely odd since that had already told us their SENIOR engineers had already examined the phone. We thought the phone was in good hands when we shipped it to Apple. We are unclear as to why the Apple “technicians and Apple “engineers” at their facility were not able to “actually look” at my phone.  At that point we asked them to send the phone back since refused to replace the battery or bother giving a truthful explanation.We received my phone back on April 30, 2018. After 10 days, they returned the phone. However, whatever they did completely destroyed it. The phone won’t turn on at all now and their suggestion is to buy ANOTHER $700-$1,000 phone off them.No thanks.
cie_B	Nogbad	2018-05-04T22:00:00Z	1	I bought a brand new iMac with fusion drive and high sierra operating system.It continually failed to turn on and Apple subsequently decided to collect it to see what the problem was. They used a firm called Amsys who advised it needed a new part and after testing advised it would be delivered on Friday 3 May. I had an email from them asking me to contact them as it had broken completely. I spoke to them Friday to be told they would need to reboot and return to factory settings and would be delivered by 12 noon today (Saturday) needless to say it hasn’t arrived and it’s  impossible to contact either Amsys or the courier.Considering the vast amount of money this item cost me, and the fact it’s only just over 3 months old  the service is diabolical..I wish I’d never bought the thing.I can’t even find a complaints department.

In addition to over £500 in subscription fees, I was charged regardless for all iTunes purchases.After a month of back and forward emails I was informed of how sorry Apple were that they were unable to assist due to ‘decision making that they can’t go into’ and was give a few iTunes gift vouchers, worth a fraction of what I have paid out.BEWARE, I would not reccommend having any bank cards saved on your Apple account. As I said, these hundreds of pounds of additional charges were stolen from my account without my knowledge or consent after having repeatedly declined subscription services.Absolutely sickened and disgusted that Apple can continue to get away with this blatant theft.

Customer service try act like they are helpful but all in all they still did nothing after spending time around working trying to sort it all out. Paid upfront for the phone and everything.  Can’t be bothered to explain it all but even their report they did showed it was faulty. Have no trust in Apple. And just watching watchdog finding out more things.

cie_B	Trish the Dish	2018-04-28T22:00:00Z	1	"Despite the fact that Apple is the most powerful and successful BRAND in the world-Do they not believe in Customer Service? Although their CEO insists that the ""company doesn't want to be a cash hoard"" do they have any empathy or concerns for their millions of customers? My daughter is a college student who we believed a MacBook Air would be an invaluable asset for her education, despite the cost. It stopped working last week after only using it 3.5 years. If we knew that we would have this huge problem after investing what we did in the laptop, and the disregard for helping the customer that we have experienced, we would’ve thought twice about choosing Apple. I am disgusted by their lack of customer service. My daughter had experienced slowness with the MacBook a few weeks before, and we took it to our local Apple store here in Kansas. They diagnosed the issue, and said that everything was running smoothly. They had kept the laptop for two days at this point. This meant my daughter, in her final semester of college, was not able to work on papers or projects during this time. Now, only 2 weeks from her degree and a very costly! repair we have found no consistent information from Apple. They do not offer any sort of student aid programs, and flat-out refused for us to take the microchip hard drive from her laptop so we could try and retrieve her projects. There are companies that do this all the time, but Apple said that the microchip in the MacBook is forbidden to be removed from their stores or repair facilities. Parts that we OWN! These projects are ESSENTIAL  for graduation; not to mention the laptop also houses her resume, cover letter, and senior projects. I have never seen the amount of anxiety from my daughter that this issue has caused.  The techs we did speak to admitted that the hard drive should have lasted for many more years. Even after explaining the urgency of resolving this issue, the tech support person said that it would be a week before we could get an appointment.  The manager of the store was “too busy” to help us. We got the run around multiple times after HOURS of waiting on hold and speaking to many people. At one point, a tech even stated the issue would be an easy fix, and take five minutes to repair. Now, Apple is stating that the hard drive was defective and refuse to help us. This is a time in my daughter’s life that she should be enjoying the fruits of her labor regarding her college education. Instead, she is devastated over something that should not be Apple’s policy in the first place. Again, what happened to customer service? Where would Apple be without their customers? Apple should be held accountable and resolve this issue immediately."

Apple sends me an email effectively calling me a liar and saying that I did not disclose the extent of the damage. The damage was caused by Apple’s poor craftsmanship of the sensors on the bottom of the watch which cracked from normal wear. The unit had never been dropped. They went on to tell me that it would cost me $289.00 to repair. Nearly the cost of the watch itself. Buyer beware!

cie_B	Jon	2018-04-14T22:00:00Z	1	Review left on Google for Rockaway Townsquare Mall looks cation today but its directed just as much at corporateApple has gotten continually worse at customer service and my experience today confirms this not only with the customer service in this store but with corporate in general.  I recently upgraded from an Iphone 6s plus to an Iphone X.  I did so thru my cell phone carrier at the cell phone carriers location. I went there instead of Apple because of convenience from my home and so I wouldnt have to go to the mall which I hate.  I was not able to trade in my phone because of an activation lock from Apple.  It was locked with an email address that was not mine indicating someone may have gotten the serial number to my phone and used it for another phone. Not my fault at all. Breach of Apples security.  After spending multiple hours on the phone with Apple they said they would send me a receipt from my original Iphone 6s plus purchase which i bought at Rockaway Apple.  With that receipt I could go to Apple and show them proof of purchase and they would then finally be able to unlock the phone and take the phone for a $175 credit.  I received the receipt 2 days later and went to Apple Rockaway today.  After 30 min of back and forth they were finally able to unlock the phone and thry also confirmed someone probably ripped off the serial number and reused it. Again news to me and not my fault.  They then told me they would give me a $175 gift card for the trade in but first wanted to scan the serial number of my new Iphone X.They did and then proceeded to tell me that because I purchased my new Iphone at the cell phone carrier location instead of Apple that they couldnt take my Iphone 6s plus and that i’d have to go online with Apple to handle this. They said this was to encourage customers to buy directly from Apple.  By this point I was getting angry and asked to speak to a manager and unfortunately the manager was useless saying the same thing about encouraging customers to buy from Apple.  Who cares where I bought the Apple Iphone from? Why sell products thru other companies if that is your best answer? I have purchased thousands of dollars worth of Apple laptops, Desktops for my company, more Ipads than I care to say and too many accesories.  And you can’t take my trade in because I bought my new phone at one of the cell phone carrier locations they support?  Your answer is to encourage customers to buy thru Apple?  What your doing is inconveniencing the customer and encouraging the customer to not buy anything at all from Apple.  I would reconsider buying Apple products at this point for multiple reasons and I would definitely discourage customers from going to Rockaway Townsquare mall Apple if you have a problem.  They are not helpful. I dealt with 3 employees total over the course of an hour in the store and left the store angry and with nothing solved and my old Iphone 6s plus in my hand.Thanks
cie_B	Martin Howells	2018-04-13T22:00:00Z	1	iPhone X is the worst phone on the planet back camera glass is made of the most fragile glass on the market meaning almost everyone’s will break. get a mark on it and your warranty is voided. Also Face ID does not work, mine has deactivated itself and apple refused to fix it due to the unrelated damage on the back. This phone is badly designed over priced and frankly unfit for consumer use. Buy one at your peril.
cie_B	Braden Lathram	2018-04-12T22:00:00Z	1	"My Iphone X which I had for less than 3 months turned off all of a sudden and the next day the battery started swelling in the phone. It swelled up so bad the phone cracked apart in the middle on the front and back of the phone, exposing the entire inside of the device. I was in Thailand when this happened, and anyone who has been there in April knows it is extremely humid and very hot. I had to truck around this phone that was now exposed to the elements for the next 2 weeks before I was able to get back to the United States and take it to Apple. The Apple store evaluated the device, checked for any other damage besides the battery and also checked the water damage indicator to make sure nothing else could have caused this to happen. There was no indication of water damage or physical damage to the phone so they sent it off to ""Apple Repair Center"" for them to look at it in more detail and told me the phone would be replaced....everything so far has been handled like it would be expected, until ""Apple Repair Center"" decides the phone must have had water damage before the battery swelled up because there was corrosion inside the device. THE DEVICE WAS CRACKED OPEN IN A VERY HUMID ENVIRONMENT FOR 2 WEEKS AND THE BATTERY EXPLODED AND LEAKED ALL INSIDE THE PHONE, OF COURSE THERE IS CORROSION!!! Their response to that was ""we have determined there must have been water damage prior to your trip to Thailand, because the corrosion couldn't have developed like this in only 2 weeks."" So they want to charge me $550 for the phone that they already charged me $700 for 3 months earlier...THAT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BS!!First of all, the Iphone X is supposed to be water proof/resistant so how did water get inside the phone if there was no sign or indication water had entered the phone before taking it apart to see corrosion? Second of all, if there was corrosion in that phone before I went to Thailand, then it was in the phone when I received it brand new! That phone was never near any kind of liquids or submerged in anything...it blew up on me before I was ever able to make it to the beach to use it for photos!iPhone X - F17VQF65JCL6 Repair ID: R286736619"

Several online and store Genius(s) offered no help except to sell a new device.  Never could talk to same tech, constantly shifted to another tech (no adults in the house) or a phone rep with fuzzy English skill.National/International phone contact referred me to Apple Store for repairs that the store does not perform.Lastly, I wanted to buy to iPads and the tech could not assure me if the devices were refurbished or new.

There was a little crack on my screen but the watch was working fine. After a while I noticed that the screen is not working properly and the crack on my screen had grown bigger. I got an appointment from Apple store and went there and after talking with Apple agent and he told me that I have to pay 230$ (which he actually didn't recommend) to repair the watch since I didn't have AppleCare (Otherwise I had to pay only 50$). He said it'd be better to get a new watch cause who knows if it's gonna work properly specially if you're gonna spend that money. I was really mad. How on earth does this make sense? I paid 300$ for the whole watch and now I have to pay 230$ to repair my screen?? this is really unreasonable and ridiculous with regard to any standard of reasonableness! If that's the case Apple has to put like 20 warnings and caution labels on the watch that ""DO NOT DROP IT OR YOU HAVE TO PAY ALMOST THE FULL PRICE AGAIN"". Very disappointed!"

It has been NUMEROUS years since I have used these. I just got an IPhone. So after 10 years or so of not using my account much, now I have to remember these answers. Customers service was nice. But useless. No one is higher up than who I talked to, but yet they cannot help me. And they will not even try to send complaints and requests to apple. There should be a way to answer other questions to verify your information. I just put money on my account that I cannot use, even though I know my password. Because I cannot answer these questions. I have to answer them to get in. Well if I knew them, I would not need to reset them, would I? You would think that with so many customers that have the same problem (literally thousands and thousands) they would try to come up with a solution to help. If I put MY money on it. I should be able to use it!"

The iPhone 7 has no discernible difference to the 6 other than more memory, it was just a “push a product” out exercise - the phone is filled with glitch’s screen graphic sticks and predictive text (which I know can be turned off) is not very intuitive in fact it’s actually annoyingly counter intuitive. There is no feature that separates the 6 from the 7 Personally reading other stuff about Apple, like their continuously HOPELESS Apple stores (they’re so funny so chaotic and wrapped up in brand and tech they actually fail to see they’re failing their customers I’ve seen it myself) I think the early demise of SJ was a death knell for Apple as Steve Jobs was Apple and probably it’s time for Apple to rethink their strategy and maybe let the apple rot and move to another fruit before the whole company implodes ......

cie_B	Ros Thomas	2018-04-06T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely appalling experience.  My two month old i phone 7 just completely stopped working overnight. Took it to Apple shop, the nearest of which is over an hour's drive away from us.  They booked a consultation at their 'genius' bar.  They completely overran the timeslot so I couldn't wait any longer.  Told to come back on a weekday, was told that I couldn't book a timeslot.  Came back, after much messing around eventually saw one of their 'genius' people - given confusing and contradictory information, including being accused of having carried out an 'unauthorised modification'!!!.  We said we just wanted a new phone, but were refused, they insisting that it had to go back to their depot.  Spoke to their 'manager' who obviously had no autonomy whatsoever and wouldn't help us.  So phone sent off, about a week later got a call to say that it had been fixed and it was a screen issue.  So, our third trip to pick up the phone, actually no - we were given wrong information - it was not a screen issue at all and we were actually, finally, given a new phone.  Appalling, condescending service, from a load of kids who don't have a clue.  I am tied into this phone for two years, but will never have another one.

Filled out a support form on the website and it said they would ring within 2 minutes. The phone went immediately. The lady, who was obviously very knowledgable, sorted out my problem concerning an installation on a 2012 Mac Pro (so not exactly a new machine). Everything works. Very impressed.
cie_B	Pat	2018-04-02T22:00:00Z	1	I understand why 1328 reviewers on Trust Pilot gave Apple the worst rating—1 star.  Most cited terrible customer service.  I agree.  How incompetent and indifferent can a company be when they lock you out of your phone for a month because you used the wrong method of their 2 methods for logging onto the iphone.  That’s right.  Despite their having set up my iphone and having a record of my owning it, they treated me like a thief because I had tried to use the thumbprint method after rebooting it (for some reason they wanted the other less secure method, the password.  Since I no longer used the password, it didn’t come to mind.  Apple’s immediate response—Thief!  Give us you receipt.  I gave it.  No, not enough, you thief.  Give us the receipt of the receipt of the person you bought it from!!!  Miraculously, I was able to obtain it.  Well, that will take another week to find somebody on the Activation Committee to look at the receipt!!  In the meantime, with the account recoveries and the trips to the Apple store and the phone calls to Apple, I’ve been locked out of my phone for almost a month and I’m still paying Verizon for service I can’t use. All because I used the wrong log-in method!  Apple employees take my abysmal treatment in stride.  Apparently, this is business as usual at Apple.  May I recommend Android; this would never happen with an Android phone!

cie_B	LaRanne English-Lawrence	2018-03-25T22:00:00Z	1	"Apple techs broke my iPhone 6 Plus after taking it in for a battery upgrade.Back in January 2018, I called Apple support due to slow default apps on my phone.  I was told I need to get the battery upgraded after running test. I was also told the battery would not be in until late March 2018.  I received a call to inform me the battery was in the first week of March and I did a drop-off on March 8th in Oakbrook, IL with an excellent condition phone, fully working phone.  I paid $31.18.  I received it back without the transmitter working and 41% charged battery.  I reached out to Apple support and was given an appt. to go to the Lincoln Park store on March 16th to have it repaired. After much waiting and paid twice for parking, $12.00, I was returned a BROKEN PHONE by Austin. Around 1:01 p.m. during our dialogue of the solution, Austin said he was going to get me a NEW iPhone 7 plus for the inconveniences. (They did not properly follow protocol to confirm they had the part in prior to breaking my phone). I repeated back for a confirmation and he said yes we will be getting you a new iPhone 7 plus. Austin said I had to go to the Magnificent Mile store to pick it up, (which was a larger inconvenience for me to get there).  I requested to speak to a manager to learn why I am being further inconvenienced to get my phone and he got Daious, appearing apathetic, stating that I must go to Magnificent Mile to get an iPhone 6s plus to replace the phone they broke (iPhone 6 plus).  I told him what Austin told me that I will receive a (new iPhone 7 plus) and he told me that's not what I will be receiving.  I asked him to contact corporate and he told me no, I can call corporate if I like. (THEY BROKE MY PHONE which had NO display to make a call).  I told Daious you guys broke my phone to make it non-functional and now you send me out of here with no communications, these are not options I agree with and I like him to give me a new phone from his location and he said ""That's not going to happen and if I leave with the broken phone, he will no longer assist me"".  Daious also admitted his techs did not follow protocol before taking in the phone to repair and he will deal with that on the back end.  I told him to give me a printed work order of what they done and the useless phone they broke and I am leaving. (He took 20 minutes and I had to send another store manager to seek him).  I left out and came home and called Ava at corporate and emailed her about the problem and she contacted Lincoln Park and Magnificent mile store.  She said she is not sure she can get me an iPhone 7 Plus but she should be able to get the iPhone 6s plus and a wallet and privacy screen (to replace the one I had and just repurchased) $26.45.  Ava confirmed there will be an iPhone 6s plus waiting for me at Magnificent mile.  After getting assistance to get there and sending a family member in (due to no parking),they returned with a phone wrapped in plastic. I got back home late night to hurry and get my data restored and run the serial number only to learn I have a 6 Plus (NO UPGRADE). I emailed Ava to tell her of my frustrations and deceptions and she responded back I was supposed to receive an upgrade and she was sorry.  After going to Old Orchard location about people not hearing me talk, I brought up my reimbursement for my battery I paid for in the broken phone and they took all of 30 minutes to convince me it was new. He avoided putting it in writing until I insisted several times after they said they can't do anything more to help my situation at Lincoln Park store (Gus-Tech, and Rebecca -Team Lead).  After several communications and escalations with corporate, Michael was involved on 3/25/18 and I told him I wanted him to investigate this whole ordeal and return my call on 3/26/2018.  After his return call, he told me since there was no documentation about the upgrade and the store personnel said I misunderstood, there is nothing more he can do for my case and he was closing it. I have proof and an upgrade was supposed to be honored and I feel this was deliberate to get me to purchase a new iPhone. I filed a complaint with BBB today and requested for them to contact Apple on my behalf to fight this cause.  I want other consumers to be aware.This matter is still ongoing and now being reviewed by another Sr. Advisor."

But be warned this is only under strict laboratory testing conditions advises Cain - manager for the day at Broadway, Sydney store. Like the Apple ads his manner - and that of his colleague Samuel - is slick, clean cut and totally uncompromising as they tell us we will need to pay close to $500 for a replacement phone that they say has been damaged by liquid.  Sadly the phone is a little over a year old and will cost us over $1000.Despite the glossy ads (and the website statements) showing people leaving their iPhone 7 sitting in a watery pool the iPhone can be adversely affected by a short exposures to steam or burst of water, something else the dynamic duo tells us.  We are surprised as the iPhone hasn’t been near steam let alone immersed in water. Samuel also tells us the protective cover we paid $70 for has gaps where liquid can get in. When we explain again the phone has not been near water,  young clean cut Samuel replies with an American smile “we (Apple staff at the Genius Bar) have not been with phone during its life- all we can go off are the indicators” he says...the inference is we are lying.  Our phone will now go to a watery grave - as will our  loyalty to Apple.

cie_B	Admin All Hallows	2018-03-21T23:00:00Z	1	"Took my Mac Book Pro in the Genius Bar to sort out the issue for the 4th time and not counting unlimited phone call on the so call ""Customer Service"" which is bad as ever.  Let me begin with the Customer Service over the phone, every I called up Apple service I will guarantee you be on the phone more than an hour and the problem is still not solve as they don't talk the same language as one will say one thing and the other will say something else also they will put you on hold most of the time as most of them do not know how to deal with the issues and they will direct you to the store and in there is even worst, you see lots of what you call the ""staff"" is walking around and not really helping you in anyone, I was there my 4th time round to sort out the same issue and what I got back was they done everything in the procedure and basically there is nothing we can do so bugger off.  I have a using Apple for 10 years and very disappointed and sad with people in Apple how they run the business since Steve Job passed away.  If it continue to be like this,  Apple will not be able to stay for any longer.    I never felt so angry and annoyed as you brought this expensive piece of gadget and all I got back was they have done everything according to the ""procedure"" and there is nothing else we can do and oh yes there is!!!  just check your machine and make sure it is passed the QC (oh no what QC? oops there isn't a QC department) before you launch it to the public!!!"

cie_B	Janae M.	2018-03-17T23:00:00Z	1	I’m not one to complain, but Apple repair is a joke. After my son cracked his new iPhone 7 screen, I went online and scheduled an appointment at the Apple store in Johnson City, clicking on the option to repair a cracked screen, so they knew what it was for. Then, after driving over an hour to the store, we’re informed they can’t replace screens there, that we’ll have to go to the Knoxville store. I asked why I was allowed to make an appointment for that when they don’t even do it and he said that happens all the time. Really? Well, maybe they don’t need to have appointments available for services they don’t even do. After wasting an entire afternoon, we made another appointment in Knoxville for another day, which is also an hour away. After waiting an hour for them to fix my son’s phone, which only made the damage worse, we’re told they can’t replace it because of a small dent on the corner, which we hadn't even noticed until the tech pointed it out. They suggested replacing it or buying another phone, which we refused and left.The screen continued to get worse, to the point a new phone was inevitable, so we decided to try one of those random screen repair kiosks at the mall, since it couldn’t hurt anything, at this point, and he was able to replace it in ten minutes. (TEN MINUTES!) Yes, it cost $85, but it looks brand new again… and much cheaper than a new phone.I don’t know if this is something Apple usually does so you’ll buy a new phone, but how can the actual maker of the phone not be able to replace a screen and some random guy at a kiosk can? Seems a bit odd, wouldn’t you say?
cie_B	Diana-and James Chatham	2018-03-17T23:00:00Z	1	I contacted Apple by phone about my MacBook Air laptop that the battery needed replacing. I was quoted $129 and I could go to any Apple store for replacement. I went to Apple Westfarms, West Hartford CT. Not onc , not twice but three times.The first two times I did not have an appointment and chose not to wait but I did speak to technicians each time and explained the year of my MacBook. They suggested I make an appointment which I did for today. I arrived and within 5 minutes was speaking with someone who informed me they don't carry batteries for my MacBook. I stated I have wasted three LONG DISTANCE trips here where no one previously told me This store does'nt don't carry replacement batteries for my computer. APPLE CARE also did not inform me of this  and I advised them I was going to the Westfarms store. I was also told there is no one nearby that does stock battery replacements. SO Customers before you spend $1,200 for one of their computers be aware that once the warranty is over, you may be on your own in dealing with the issues. I will never purchase another Apple product and i advise others to be wary due to very poor service once out of warranty.

(I couldve told anyone that) But have to have their expertise. So, set appointment with nearest apple store(45 min. away) took the afternoon off. Arrived at my appointment, they did not have battery available, it had to be ordered. They said this was just my time slot! Really???!! My time slot so I could take off work and spend over an hour an a half driving. So they said they could order battery and they would graciously let me know when it arrived. I could then come in and be put in the que and wait around 2 hours for my battery to be installed. Apple cares about customers? I dont think so. Didnt order battery. will wait till phone dies and buy from a company with some service."
cie_B	coral anderson	2018-03-12T23:00:00Z	1	I went to the Apple store in ''Mall at Millenia' in Florida USA to have a new battery fitted into my macbook air. They confirmed that it did need one, but as they didn't have one in stock they would have to order it and they would contact me when it was in stock which would be 3-5 days.   I waited 7 days and then e-mailed them, I received no reply and I am now back in the UK and still haven't had an e-mail and I'm not expecting one now. If they couldn't get the battery they should have let me know, such bad customer service.
cie_B	Alexis Nicole	2018-03-12T23:00:00Z	2	Apple Inc. Is not the worst company out there. They actually have a neat variety of cellular and other devices.  Apple is going a little bit overboard on their products.  Before 2019 hits, there will be over 20 different types of Iphones. It's crazy. We started off with a square, small Iphone, known as the iphone 3. Then it was the 4, 4s, then 5,5s,5c,5 se,Iphone se, 6,6+, 6s+, 7, 7+, 8, 8+,Iphone x. There are just too many. I honestly think they should've stopped with Iphone 6+. The Iphone X doesn't even have any buttons, it's just on big screen, basically.  IT'S UGLY, in my opinion. I am not hating on apple because I do love their products such as their computers, and phones. Just not that there are so many unnecessary device. It benefits them a lot because they make billions of dollars for the most stupidest thing. I like APPLE, but I don't like it enough where I will spend $2,000 on one phone. LOWER YO PRICES, MAN.

I also Bought a Macbook Pro and a Mac which were like 3 grand or more the one that looks like just a screen literally just died after my driver and many other things started to fail my macbook Pro the keys just pop off eventually and the driver as well failed I smashed the living crap out of those because well they refuse to fix it even if you have warranty all i can say is after all this Apple can kiss my butt.. Their products suck all other phones are better then this piece of useless trash with glass you call a phone, Only thing these so called phones are good for is a paper weight or just to smash the crap out of them or hope for it to blow up ect so you can sue the crap outta them.. ,,I,, <<< swivel on that Apple.
cie_B	Connie Yanez	2018-03-11T23:00:00Z	1	STAY CLEAR OF APPLE Purchased an iPhone X and paid 1200.00.   Discovered it was defective within 5 weeks of purchasing it.  The phone was freezing, screen randomly going dark, and the microphone  malfunctioning.  I contacted  Apple and spoke to a representative by the name of Bridget Ball.  Bridget assured me that Apple would replace my phone with a new IPhone X.  Welll, Bridget Ball never followed through, I waited over a week and she never took my calls nor responded to my voicemails.  Today I spoke to another representative by the name of Harold, who also assured me a brand new replacement then proceeded to transfer me to his supervisor Josh.  Josh denied Bridget Ball’s agreement about replacing my phone with a new phone.  I told Josh that I wanted a new phone as I had originally purchased.  He said he would only send me a refurbished phone because I had the phone for 15 days past the purchase date.  I asked to speak to his supervisor hoping to get what I was originally promised as Josh was attempting to intimidate me by firmly stating he would not replace my phone with a new phone.  Josh told me he was the highest ranking supervisor and refused to allow me to speak with someone else at APPLE who might consider my expectations as I was promised.  Bottom line Apple is not what it use to be. May Steve Jobs Rest In Peace.  No more Apple products for me, my family, or friends, I will encourage anyone to stay clear of very expensive Apple products. They will never duplicate Mr. Jobs legacy. In fact in my opinion they are failing.  Remember their battery life unethical issue recently?  I’m looking forward to a brand new SAMSUNG phone.  I’m out $1,200 but it’s worth it to save you readers the same iunfortunate and very expensive mistake and experience I had by staying loyal to APPLE.  APPLE can sell defective products and gain on battery replacements as well as cheat customers out of quality instruments.  Why, because they get away with it!

Apple immediately swapped the handset - all good.7 months later screen digitiser goes bad. Return to Apple with 7 month old handset to be told that swapped handsets, despite being new, only have a 3 month warranty. So Apple only have 3 months confidence in their handsets and l get a £170 bill.I thought Apple were a premium quality product, obviously not.Will not buy another Apple product.1*.........

I found others discussing this online and tried what they suggested.  I called Apple and waited, listening to grating music, then got a robot named Rob, who said he was a real person.  He had no idea what I was talking about and I had to repeat myself several times.  He told me to press continue.  Then new icons appeared at the bottom of the screen with Apple pay in them.  I was told I could turn it off by going to wallet in settings.  I did this and can now text messages.  He said this was just the normal way things are done at apple.  Block my screen unless I accept something I didn't ask for and don't want to use?!  A first. Shame on you Apple!
cie_B	Laura Finney	2018-03-05T23:00:00Z	1	I went into the Apple Store in Kenwood Ohio because my iphone SE was not charging due to a broken charging port. I was told by a worker from the “genius bar” that they could not just fix the charging port because it wasn’t just it’s own part but was connected to the whole phone. So therefore I would need to replace my entire phone costing me $269. Thinking all was lost I was indeed going to buy a new iPhone but decided to upgrade to a newer phone which would have cost me $549 (and that’s not even for the newest phone). Minutes before buying the new phone I thought maybe I should check one of those kiosks in the mall that fix phones. Sure enough, they could and did fix my “broken phone” that apple said was not able to be fixed.  Not only did it only take 30 minutes to do but it only cost me $42!!!! My phone works perfectly!! Apple lied right to my face so they make more money off of me. This is absolutely ridiculous and makes me never want to give apple a dime more of my money! BEWARE!!! Apple is just a bunch of scammers making billions off people who trust them.

Apple really needs to up their ethics game as they're happy to rip us off for the product and then reward us with slow software and dodgy batteries.
cie_B	Tatev Soghomonyan	2018-03-04T23:00:00Z	1	A month ago I bought a new iPhone 8 and the next day the wifi toggle was frozen. I went to the Yerevan service center, they made a factory reset, it worked. Came back home, next morning the same problem. Went back to the service center, they reinstalled the Os, it worked, but .... next day it stoped again. After 1 week Apple service center decided to replace my device, so I waited for 2 weeks and guess what! The second device had the same problem. It took another week till service center agreed to replace the second device. Now I'm waiting again and don't have an idea how long can this take.I can't describe how big is my disappointment, as I don't even want to see an iPhone anymore. It took me 1 month without phone, which affect a lot my work efficiency as I cannot pass the two factor authentication at my workplace. I'm a UX designer and this is my first experience with iPhone. Before I had great expectations, but now it became my nightmare. I wish I could return the phone and forget about it once and forever. I wish I had bought another brand, doesn't matter what.
cie_B	Nikki	2018-03-02T23:00:00Z	1	I brought an iPhone after 33 days after an update the phone broke and it wouldn't switch on, I went to the local 02 shop where this was purchased they told me because it was after 30 day return policy I had to go to Apple, So I rang and explained they helped me and after 2 hours it was working again, it happened numerous times I was fobbed off, they said I could send it back to fix it and then after 5 weeks it came back un fixed, I was so annoyed, I took it to Windsor and they said as I had opened a case on the phone to apple they couldn't do anything so they would cancel the job and I would come back the next day, but the next day I went back and said it was still not cancelled they said I could phone them on a public phone as they were expecting a call off the police, I said give me the phone back and thanked them for wasting my time, when I rang apple it took another 2 hours on the house phone, another temp fix, Phillip said it was indeed faulty, and offered me a reconditioned phone I would have to travel 33 miles and foot the bill again, I said no I brought a new hone and expect a new phone in a new sealed box back, I also said I cannot go far as I have spinal condition and heart condition, he said I could upgrade but it would cost me more because all iPhone 6s 16gb have been recalled so I could pay the difference for a 32gb 6s REFURBISHED PHONE. so 18 months down the line I still have the faulty phone but I am seeking legal advice, its criminal, I cannot use the camera as it switches off at this point, turns on and off anyway , crackly line, battery could die at 40% and cannot handle the updates.to make the best of it I cant put the contract sim in another phone as it is smaller but I have all my contacts calling this and I pay for minutes, data and messeges on that particular sim.Terrible customer service I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER IPHONE AGAIN.

cie_B	Caroline	2018-03-01T23:00:00Z	1	My experience was awful. Both tech employees I talked to were absolutely rude. My phone was covered under warranty and had a manufacturer defect. When I asked about possibly being sent a new one of the same model, he laughed in my face. It was extremely unprofessional. Considering I paid hundreds of dollars for my Apple product I really expected decent customer support.
cie_B	Peter Butterworth	2018-03-01T23:00:00Z	2	"I bought my first desktop Apple about twelve years ago. The product was excellent and the service superb. Apple was carrying the Job's service values into the market, backing them up with faultless customer support and offering a genuinely alternative consumer experience.Now, sadly, those values have been lost in Apple's relentless drive for increased commercial expansion and profiteering. The technical consistency that was a hallmark of Apple products has gone - my problems with my newish iMac provide a relevant example:     • About 2-3 years ago I updated my iMac just before going into hospital for several weeks. When I returned home I found my iMac overrun with ""duplicate files"". My documents folder had increased from 3gb to over 90gb, my contacts had suffered severe duplication along with several entries being completely deleted. My ""Pages"" library, containing my work-documents, was in a state of complete chaos with duplicated and missing documents. My iTunes library was also in a similar state of chaos. I rang Apple, expecting them to invite me to take my iMac to their store where, hopefully, they would sort it out. No invite was given and instead I was urged to sort it out myself with help from telephone support. So began a long series of phone calls with Apple support - I tried to keep my number of advisors to a minimum but this proved to be impossible. Involuntary ""File Duplication"" is a complex issue and very, very few Apple Support Advisors have the least idea of how to tackle it, instead they will lead you blindly through procedures that will leave you in a state of utter chaos and confusion. Apple telephone support works best with quick-fix problems that can be solved in 10 minutes or so, it DOES NOT WORK with extensive problems that require joined-up thinking over several weeks.If I were to invoice Apple at my professional rate for time spent on this issue (a procedure on which I am taking legal advice) they would find themselves looking at a invoice of several thousand pounds.  My iMac is the last Apple product I shall buy, a consumer relationship that once held so much promise and respect has ended up as the worst consumer experience  of my life."
cie_B	Rebecca E	2018-03-01T23:00:00Z	1	I have had Apple devices for over 20 years. For the past year, I have very seriously considered changing my iPhone for a Samsung. I used to love Apple Customer Service and could not stop talking about it to friends and family, got my entire family on Apple devices, and convinced many more to switch to Apple. However, for the last several years, I have come TO DISLIKE IT so much!!! How many bad experiences can anyone have with the same people, especially when everyone around you tells you the same exact thing- their experience with Apple Customer Service was miserable- THAT IS ALL YOU HEAR THESE DAYS- NOONE ANYMORE LOVES APPLE LIKE WE USED TO YEARS AND YEARS AGO- EVERYONE WE KNOW IS SOOOO FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY WITH APPLE AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE- The latest saga with them-my iPhone 6 was exactly 1 year old a year ago, when the battery suddenly started failing non stop ( i only use my phone for email and texting, and to read the news headlines,  some safari search and nothing else). I went to 2 stores in NYC, called Apple on the phone, talked to every manager and supervisor in sight to obviously argue my case that the battery had to be defective , and they ALL gave me the same Company lines- that the battery was fine and usage was normal. Went to a third party who said battery was defective and changed it, for which I paid. A few months later, Apple admitted to the slowing down they had arranged on their phones as well as the problems with their iPhone 6 batteries!!!Recently, I wanted to change my battery again when they announced the 29.99 $ deal, had to wait 6 weeks to get an appointment, and when I went, they said they would not change the battery because a third party had previously changed it!!!!!! I REALLY CANNOT STAND APPLE ANYMORE!!!!! This was the 3RD TIME they screwed me up over THIS ONE BATTERY! I have rarely been abused by Customer Service so badly in my life!!!!! AVOID APPLE IF YOU CAN- GO TO THE COMPETITOR!!!!!!!!
cie_B	Graham Darwood	2018-02-28T23:00:00Z	1	Had a MacBook Pro bought for around £1500 at the time.  Also purchased Apple Care.  Eventually Apple accepted liability for the screen staining and was advised that screen would be replaced as manufacturer had accepted liability for the fault.  All good and dandy and screen would be replaced under the Apple Care warranty.  Subsequently Apple claimed that the product was water damaged and had a battery fault [refused to disclose photos or evidence to me] and then insisted that the product would need to be repaired at my cost before the inclusive screen warranty repair could be done.  Machine by this stage almost 3 years old with a second hand value of approximately £600.00.  Cost for the work before Apple would even entertain their liability in respect to the [agreed work at Apple's expense] stained manufacturing screen fault [you guessed it] around £600.00 inclusive of VAT.  Apple would also only give a 3 month warranty on any repair which is poor given the cost of £600.00 involved.Spent hours arguing my case with CS and in the store.  Unreasonable and rude staff [Apple Shop Milton Keynes], CS not prepared to offer any gesture or exercise discretion and whole attitude was do not care!  Really disappointing and will be reluctant to buy any other Apple product going forward!!  The CS experience was shockingly poor and stressful.  Basically, do not expect premium quality after care and I have doubts about the premium quality of their products given the issues I experienced with the screen staining.  Avoid this company if you can, do not buy the Apple Care nor expect any redress or aftercare.  Disappointing and deflating in all respects :((I have since had the battery and water damage repaired locally at less than a third of the cost quoted by Apple and I now invite Apple to do the morally and socially right thing [corporate responsibility and such like] and repair my stained screen at no cost??  I doubt that Apple will do so but here is my open invitation on social media to them??UPDATE MARCH 2018 - no responses nor contact from Apple Customer Service!!UPDATE APRIL 2018 - no responses nor contact from Apple Customer Service!!

I’ve been with apple for last 8 years and have a iPhone 6 but last month, I switched to Samsung and I don’t think I go back to iPhone again cos I’m fed up with it. If I don’t see major change, I will switch my tablets and other apple stuff to Samsung as well.
cie_B	Ian Sheppard	2018-02-27T23:00:00Z	1	"Had I known when I bought the iPad Pro that a cracked screen would mean that the device would cost almost the same to fix it as it would to replace it then I would never have bought the product.  $590 is an unreasonable cost to replace the glass cover screen.  Apparently the LCD is integrated to the glass cover and the whole thing needs to be replaced.  Apple Support gave me a bunch of useless suggestions that still circled back around to a $590 repair bill.  I even got a few tips on parenting (ie keep it away from my 5 year old), which, after the fact just served to infuriate me.  I plan to rubbish this product as far and as wide as possible unless Apple agree to reasonable repair cost under a ""CS code""."

cie_B	Heidi Nixon	2018-02-26T23:00:00Z	1	I just left your store and you are lucky if I ever return. And I bought over $5000 worth of product here at Christmas alone. (I should’ve gone to Best Buy). I know you probably don’t think twice about losing a customer because Apple employees do not care about HELPING the consumer that purchase their devices.The man at the front door did not care that I needed help. I walked in at 12:23 and I had an appointment at 12:30. I had made a mistake and made my appointment at the North Park store. The man said oh it’s OK you can still make it. (How the heck could I have made it on time?? It was 12:23! Shows his dismissal right there). I told him I just needed my battery looked at and possibly replaced and the consumers were told by Apple in December we could walk in for that and an appt wasn’t necessary. He told me to go to the northpark store. He told me it would be 4 hours before anyone could see me. (REALLY? I guess I look that stupid). It’s not my 1st time to walk in on a Tuesday. I told him I am a customer and he is sending me away and that does not say anything good about his store. He replied “thank you.” I told “you’re welc me” and then I told him his store is crap. Now you tell me, is that the kind of person you want working your front door?  Whoever you are reading this I’m sure you do not care either. I have NEVER EVER had anything but DECENT customer service at this store. You hire people and could care less about the customer service they give. Why?? Why is “decent” the standard for customer service of devices that are very expensive?   The devices we buy are not cheap at all. So why would this store insist on giving mediocre customer service?? WHY?? I wish I could do more than just leave a message or email. I really wish I could do so much more for you to understand the pathetic customer service your store stands for. I can’t wait to see who puts y’all out of business. It will happen eventually. You can’t treat paying customers like they don’t matter and encourage them to leave your store.  I felt completely “unwanted” as a customer. But I think that was the man’s intent. So “Thank you” for showing me the true integrity of your store.
cie_B	Sara Hattersley	2018-02-25T23:00:00Z	1	I made a few one hundred dollar purchases on a game for my iPad.  I didn’t realize that my account became over drafted until today.  None of the purchases have been credited to my iPad at this point but they can not refund the money they are charging me.  I spoke with supervisor John on the phone and he was very kind in saying that there was absolutely nothing he could do even though my iPad was not credited with anything.  Now I’m stuck paying overdraft fees on items I’ve already purchased with prepaid gift cards.  Do not ever put your debit card on file because they will no do anything whatsoever to assist you once you’ve made even an accidental charge to your account.Sincerely,Sara Hattersley

cie_B	Arman	2018-02-23T23:00:00Z	1	I have bought MacBook Pro 13inch with touch bar in July 2017. It was running a bit ok on the first few months. After that, it started restarting on its own. It says Kernel restart every single time. It hangs on me and I am unable to work with it. So I called the apple support and they did some test but could not fix the issue. Later I went to the apple store in the genius bar on a Thursday afternoon. Waited 2 hours to see someone. Finally, someone was there to see me. They did some testing and the guy told me that it is an issue with the hardware and they do not have the hardware on stock so they have to order it and I had to go there again to drop it off. So they called me back when the parts arrived and its half an hour away from where I live so went there and gave it to them. They changed the motherboard and told me that the issue has been fixed. It was on January 18, 2018, I received my laptop. After two days of using it,t the problem started again. I am unable to save anything on my laptop as it gets restarted every time. It makes weird fan noise and hangs on me every time. As I got busy with work, I was unable to find time to get it fixed, so called to book an appointment and each time I call, they say we are booked for this week. Finally, on Feb 23, 2018, I was able to go there. I showed my laptop to the genius bar again and they did some testing again and said it is my hard drive that I am having an issue with. I was told to leave the laptop to them and they will return it after 5 business days. I told to give me a spare laptop but told me to buy a new laptop and return it after 5 days. I never had to expect this kind of solution. I am losing my patience already and told to keep the laptop and give me a new one and they said, they have to try it three times before I get a new laptop. Well, I was very pleased with my windows laptops. I had never had this kind of issues with Windows laptop, and I do not know what else to say. I am never ever buying another MacBook again. Microsoft surface laptops are the best products on the market.

cie_B	Mike	2018-02-21T23:00:00Z	1	"I've bought loads of Mac kit over the years, iPhone 4, 5, 5c, 6+, two iPhone 7's, two Mac mini's, three iPads!,  a G5 back in the day, a 27"" thunderbolt monitor - when I think of how much money I've personally given to them over the years it makes me sick to my stomach that when I first needed a repair.The battery won't charge on my iPhone 6+, it's a common fault and they are offering £25 repairs at the moment because they know there is an issue. I went online to report it and after chatting to someone for an hour they wanted £336.44 to repair it (promising to return any money that I overpaid).£336.44 is quite different to £25.I am now stuck with a useless phone that wasn't fit for purpose that I guess I'll just have to go down a different route with but one thing is for sure, I will NEVER buy a piece of apple equipment again. I am sure the money I have spent which is a lot for me is just a drop in the ocean to them but if it helps anyone make a decision on whether to buy Apple equipment in the future then taking the time to write this will be worth it."
cie_B	Averey Elise Armogida	2018-02-20T23:00:00Z	1	Before I got my iPhone 7+ in December I had always been a loyal android customer but after hearing great things about apple I wanted to give them a try. Since switching I have been nothing but disappointed with them and after this past weekend I am pretty upset at myself for giving apple a chance. Since day 1 I have been fighting apple to fix my phone. It has always froze and took a good 10 seconds to power down and then turn back on. Your customer service reps informed me it is my fault and it’s the apps I use (Snapchat, Facebook, messenger, instagram). I use everyday apps everyone else has on their phone. So after a couple months it kept getting worse and worse and no one would do anything about it. This past weekend my phone froze, shut off, and wouldn’t turn back on. I was told I have to take it to an apple store unless I want to wait ten days or pay 30 to get it here in 5-7days. I’m an on call nurse and don’t have the luxury of not needing a phone. So I had to waste my time and gas driving 2 hours to madisyn Wisconsin (closest store to me). Before I left my house I called and set an appointment. However little did I know this was just going to make a bigger headache. I get to the store and they inform me the rep I talked to never put in my appointment and I will have to sit here and wait ANOTHER 2 hours. Finally someone comes out and spends maybe 10 minutes talking to me. He tells me that if there is no water damage then I will get a new phone free of charge because I’m covered under apple care. So I sit in the same exact spot I have been for the last 2 and a half hours. Another 2 hours go by and I’m getting irritated my phone is still not done. Finally I talk to someone. They take my name and come out with my new phone. They said oh well your phone has been done it’s just waiting to be picked up. You would think the guy I talked to would have let someone know that my phone is done instead of having me waste yet ANOTHER 2 hours of my time! My phone is now fixed but I am very very disappointed in apple.

My iPhone 6 battery is ridiculous - I have to charge it 3 times a day. I've been to the store several times to resolve it, but they insist there's nothing wrong with the hardware.  Utter rubbish!You're locked in - there's no freedom.  Had I known this before, I would never have purchased Apple.  It's a ball-ache to move to Android, but I'm at the stage now where Apple have been so difficult, I will be making the move.

Finally got it and it sends you to a web address that starts the whole 6 week process again! I am in a viscous circle I cant get out of and they dont want to help.How difficult can it be to change a phone number they hold on their records? I can pass all their checks but they still dont want to help!I am now going to get rid of all things apple and try through a solicitor to get my account deleted and all my information forgotton.

cie_B	Hastings	2018-02-13T23:00:00Z	2	iPhone 8 Plus bought brand new only 2 months ago suddenly died with screen glitch. Black screen, no response, no power up - nothing.  Went to Apple store and updated to latest software, only for phone to repeatedly die, as witnessed by the receptionist person. Receptionist person said if it's a hardware fault we'll certainly replace the phone.  Still had to wait an hour for a 'Genius' to see me to confirm what receptionist had already seen - yes, software updated, yes, phone dies repeatedly with visible screen glitch.  Ran lots more tests to confirm, indeed it was more than a software issue but then refused to replace with new phone.  Insisted 'the process' was that I accept a iPhone 6 on loan for two weeks while they send off the malfunctioning phone. First loaner phone didn't even work, as I noticed before leaving with it. My pleas that any premium brand would normally offer a new replacement on the spot where it's self-evidently not fit for purpose fell on deaf ears.  All the genius could say, on repeat, was 'It's the process' and the even less helpful 'I know where you're coming from'. It would have been more honest to simply say 'Computer says No.' Hopelessly inadequate.  I can't think of any other expensive tech product where the manufacturer wouldn't be falling over themselves to apologise and instantly replace rather than increasing your frustration by giving you the liability of a loaner phone while they muse over what particular manufacturing or parts fault has led to an expensive but rubbish product. I have no idea how long they will take as they couldn't tell me. I only got this because of a manufacturing design error in the iPhone 6 Plus I had before which succumbed to 'Touch Disease' as written about on the internet and now the subject of class action lawsuits in the USA.  Yet more evasive Apple handling of that too.   Having seen the sad decline of both Apple's hardware and the well documented farce that is their software, I can confidently state this is the very last Apple product I'll ever buy, but not the last review I'll write.  Absolutely appalling complacency and contempt for ensuring customers get a working product for a high price.  A rotten apple if ever there was one.
cie_B	Jack Lowe	2018-02-13T23:00:00Z	1	Out of every company I have ever dealt with apple is by far the worst when it comes to customer services.Unhelpful, rude and show in interest in helping you.Also the fact that you have too book an appointment to even get some advice, funny that you don’t have too book when you want to buy something

cie_B	Marty	2018-02-08T23:00:00Z	1	I got so fed up with the poor quality of service I was receiving from apple when trying to purchase the new imac pro - fully loaded (about $20,000.00 CDN) that I decided to record the conversation in my final call to them. I spoke to a supervisor in sales. I informed the supervisor of my bad experience in the previous call and that I was recording this call for quality assurance. The supervisor (Lakay) told me that apple does not allow customers to record calls and asked me to stop recording. I asked Lakay if the call was being recorded by apple and she confirmed that it was. I told Lackay that I would stop recording if she stopped recording at her end. She told me that she cannot and will not stop recording and went on to say that Apple's policy allows for them to record all calls but prohibits customers from recording them themselves.Canadian law provides for any person that is involved in a telephone conversation or communication to record the call without the other person's consent. I elucidated this for Lakay but she did not care what rights the law provides to the people of Canada because, as she put it, Apple has their own views and policies on what Canadians are allowed to do. She insisted that if I do not discontinue recording the call that apple will not do business with me and that she will have to end the call. And so she did.I am taking this further as I feel my rights were violated which culminated in me being bullied by Apple.I will not deal with them again until they do a complete overhaul on their attitude.Sincerely,Marty
cie_B	Steve	2018-02-08T23:00:00Z	1	The worst service ever. Apple has gone seriously down hill over the past couple of years. Never thought I’d hear myself say this but I’m going to be moving to a Samsung galaxy.
cie_B	Lisha Bubz	2018-02-08T23:00:00Z	1	If I could give zero stars for customer service I would.  My phone completely died yesterday out of nowhere.  It won't charge or turn on at all even with a force restart.  I've been trying to contact someone over the phone but they keep telling me to provide my IMDI number.  Um how am I supposed to provide that number when it's stored in my phone won't even turn on?  Ridiculous.  So I had to go to the Sydney store during my lunch break.  I wait 20 minutes in line at the apple store only to be turned away and told to come back in 6 hours.  Great so now I have to waste more of my time going back AFTER work on a Friday night when I live an hour away from the Sydney store.  I don't appreciate having to now travel home late at night because apple refused to serve me. When I requested that I be served now because it is not my fault my phone is broken and I have absolutely no way of contacting anyone with out it, she said well do you want to call all the other customers who have the same problem and tell them you're going to take their appointment?  Um huh if they have the same problem how are they going to answer their phone?  And secondly, how rude and uncaring of apple staff to speak to me with such attitude.  $1,300.00 for a phone that breaks after 6 months out of nowhere and now i'm left in a huge mess.  Thanks heaps bro

It is accepting its charger olnly which is more expensive.  It’s head set was no good at all. Customer service in the store was really unsatisfactory.

Details will be provided soon on apple.com."" ... Men i Danmark skal man betale 325 kr. for at få det skiftet af Apple. Dette er efter min mening diskrimination på baggrund af lande. En eventuel valutakursdifference kan ikke forklare differencen mellem 29$ og 325kr. Jeg finder det dybt problematisk at i vælger ikke at efterleve jeres egen koncerns pressemeddelelser, men alligevel skal tjene lidt ekstra på det, blot fordi vi i DK ikke har en Apple Store.. Desuden begyndte jeres uvidende support medarbejder at bortforklare differencen med at de 29$ kun var prisen på batteriet og der dertil ville være omkostninger til værksted. I pressemeddelelsen skriver i jo ""battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29"" ALTSA 29$ for reparation INKL. batteri svarende til ca. 175 DKK.!!!!"

After 10 min, I finally called.  No real satisfaction there either, but short wait time - who would have thought!
cie_B	Michael Magee	2018-02-01T23:00:00Z	2	All I have to say is wow when it comes to the Apple 8 and the Apple XI'll use The Apple microphone on this  iPhone  it will have missed spelled words and I will not change them for this review   I have spent years switching the Apple products iMac iPhone iPad Apple television etc.  The Apple eight and the X  are a complete joke and not even worth half of their retail value  The last big thing Apple came out with with the phone  what is the 6S had fingerprint ID  I'm in the market for a new phone so I ordered the Apple 8 Took it out the box and said out loud why is this worth $750?   The phone was basically a souped up 6S that you can buy on eBay for around $225  So I said OK I'll compare the galaxy note 8 versus the Apple XDoing a side-by-side comparison you took less than five minutes for me to completely laugh at Apple's new phone.  Saying if anybody spend $1000 for this and they're out of their minds  So I bought the galaxy note 8 This was no fast decision it was a no-brainer decision Sam song has completely dominated and over past Apple This is extremely disappointing. If  Apple believe they can slap a price tag on their phone and put an apple name and people are stupid enough to pay for it that's their own stupidity Apple is so fast to come out with a new phone and a new price tag every six months this last fiasco is going to catch up and bite him right in the butt
cie_B	Philly	2018-02-01T23:00:00Z	1	Customer service is lousy. Apple takes little to no responsibility for their faulty products. My apple iphone 7 is having major issues. Went through apple and they say that its a Verizon issue. Verizon states that its an apple issue. I take my phone to Verizon to find that there is a woman in there having the same exact issues out of her phone and when asked what do we do when we are making a payment on the device. All she could say is get away from Apple. I am very disappointed in this product and how both entities has handled it. I have reported to the better business bureau and hopefully will get some resolve this way. I stayed away from apple for a long time due to this type of mess and decided to give them another try. This will be my LAST apple product.

cie_B	Kaylie	2018-01-31T23:00:00Z	1	They don’t seem to understand that people cannot afford the new phones, so they shove updates onto the older phones that make them worse. Just now, in a matter of 15 minutes, my battery went from 100% to 27% while on low-power mode. I wasn’t even using it. This happens on a regular basis, and I’m not the only one who has this problem. Literally all of my friends own an iPhone 6. None of them are willing to upgrade because they sau they can’t afford the new phones. If Apple is going to make their newer phones so over-priced, they should at least respect the customers who don’t have enough money to have the leisure to get those new phones. Phones are a necessity nowadays. Not everyone can afford the newest and greatesy. Apple needs to quit being selfish.
cie_B	David Levesque	2018-01-30T23:00:00Z	1	Apple has disappointed me greatly! The inconvenience caused by this iPhone battery fiasco, the lack of replacement batteries that they “offered” at 29.00 and the long wait timesI the phone to talk with someone and get any follow-through has been ridiculous. Clearly this company is toying with massive defections.
cie_B	Martin Huxter	2018-01-30T23:00:00Z	1	Around 5/6 years ago I have had a pair of Beats Earphones which I originally purchased. They came with 1 year's Warranty. The earphones failed within a year - In one ear, always the left one. Beats By Dre replaced them for me. I have emails to back up all of these cases. The same thing may have happened as many as 6-7 possibly even 8 times in the last few years. The same thing happened. Every time eventually these would be repaired or replaced. Last year in March, my case was handled brilliantly by Xander Jake Mikuda Vest. Once again I had the earphones sent in for repair or replacement. I'm not sure which of those occurred. Either way, I was told I had another year Warranty and to contact Jake if it happened again. 10 months later and it's happened again yesterday - I made a call yesterday it took 30 mins for somebody in Portugal to put me through to somebody in the UK called Janette. I was told on a recorded call that they would be doing the usual for me. I called twice more yesterday asking for an email to confirm this. I spoken with Syresh and Sayeed.I was told it had been processed. Today I called to chase this up and was hung up on several times. Eventually I spoke with Armen Kirakosian Rather than telling me the status, Armen kept me on hold for 30 minutes and then proceeded to tell me the Warranty is only valid for 90 days and they would not be helping me. Despite what was told to me by 4 different staff members on a recorded call yesterday.When the Warranty on a product is a year and you replace it, you are obligated to give somebody another year to show the product is not faulty. When it has been replaced well over 5/6 times in the past over and over again for the same reason, why am I not being sent a different product or apologised to, for Apple creating faulty products?I expect products to last longer than 1 year which is the original warranty. You cannot give somebody 1 year and then replace it in the 11th month and then tell them their claim is invalid if they get back in touch 6 months later with the same issue.

Contacts do not transfer from old iPhone and its their icloud that fails to work with the new software they created. Do not buy !!The support was not available at 1945 when the company is Global.We have fourteen apple devices but these are going back for a refund and an Android where the software works better and is not another apple add on product is the way we will go.

Talked on the phone like 30 mins each time. I even allowed them to remote access my computer. But no!! No resolution at all!! Very bad service!!! So far I loved Apple! I have my Mac Book, Ipad, Iphone etc! Everything from apple.. But I am disappointed with their customer service. And I can't download any apps to my phone just because this simple problem. What a shame Apple!!It is really getting hard to understand why they call themselves genius!

I am very disappointed in them my iPhone I have now will not hold a charge and that seems like a commen thing with a lot of the phones and they do not want to fix the problem when the phones are close to $800 . Plus the charging cords break apart so easy and they give you a hard time about replacing it . I know I’m just a small fish here cause they make lots off people and could care less but I will be changing to a different phone maker ..

After a few attempts the ipad was frozen. The tech support person who I worked with gave me her phone number and always returned my calls the day I called. After submitting all the correct documents the ipad was unfrozen and I am now using it. The tech support person I worked with was amazing - so supportive, helpful and patient. I am grateful that Apple is so protective of it's customers property, but also grateful that in certain circumstances such as mine, they have ways to help. Thank you.
cie_B	Karlo	2018-01-23T23:00:00Z	1	Yes I know everybody talks about the iphones but my experience with apple phone has been horrible. I live in New York and whenever the temperature drops in the city, the phone freezes and shuts down automatically. I called apple many times and all of what they said is that their phones cant work under extreme cold weather. Like for real??? In addition to that, my iphone screen cracked from the first week i got it, which is a common problem across iphones as their quality is the worse. I booked an appointment with the genius bar in New York Grand Central, as my phone was still under warranty. I drove all the way their the week after, and i arrived before my appointment time, and the manager said we are overbooked and you have to come another day. For real?? What is the point of having appointments on your website??? I am fed up with Apple. If only Steve Jobs can know what is happening with the collapsing empire he build.

I also have mobile insurance so I figured I could just swap out the phone.  Tmobile won't do it because I have apple care.  I don't have an appointment so I have to wait for a technician to ""diagnose"" the unresponsive phone...  Common sense was lost with apple customer service."

I don't even know how many I have had at this point. I've never been so p-o'd at APPLE and felt ripped off as I have with this laptop. Don't get me wrong, I love it but there are so many things that should not be an issue 6 weeks in! Sticky keys! Battery that lasts 4 hours when it is advertised at 10 hours! Also angry about the battery performance slow down with my iphone 6.I spent every penny I had on this laptop and you couldn't even provide a USB adapter! Or the second half of the power cord??? Speaking of cords! The usb-c cord and the power supply cost over $100. Outrageous! If the quality is anything like the lightning cables I have held together with electrical tape.This may be my last Apple computer. The company has gotten greedy. Steve Jobs would be ashamed!They deleted my complaint from their support website because it was an ""unproductive rant"". Sneaky! They don't care how upset a loyal customer of over 25 years is!?"
cie_B	Mike K	2018-01-19T23:00:00Z	1	It’s sad to see that all that Steve Jobs has built is being systematically dismantled by a bunch of tech people who don’t know how to run a billion dollar business without Jobs...I called the Apple store in Brea Mall telling them that I needed to replace my battery for my SE. The rep tells me that I need to come into the store and stand in line to schedule an appointment for that. I repeat his statement to confirm that I actually need to physically come into the store and not able to just schedule the appointment over the phone. He says ‘no’ so I drive to the mall only to find out from the rep at the store that I could’ve scheduled the appointment over the phone. What a waste of time, not to mention the genius who gave me the wrong information. I finally schedule my appointment for the following Friday to get my replacement battery. I show the following Friday, stand in line again, explain that I’m there for my appointed time to replace the battery, and the rep tells me that we need to order the part for my SE, ‘did you order the part last time you were here?’ I tell him, I didn’t know I was supposed to order the part. Proceeded to ask why they just didn’t order the part the previous week when I made the appointment. The rep tells me the line for the previous week was to schedule an appointment to order your battery.... “WHAT?! WTH is does that mean?!” I scheduled an appointment to schedule another appointment to order a battery???  Then he gets on his iPad to show me that I still have 92% of life on my battery and that I should wait for a new one. I explain to him that my battery doesn’t last for half a day anymore. He says’ it must be a background app that’s draining the battery, but conveniently doesn’t know which one. You mean to tell me that you have an app, that I can’t download, which can tell the Apple rep the life left in my battery, but can’t tell me which app is draining my battery usage.... If it smells like bs it probably is. Lastly, he tells me that a rep will call me in about 2-3 months to schedule an appointment to come in for the replacement battery.  I plan on going in again bc I’m sure that the next rep will say, ‘oh, your name is not in the system, so we’re going to have to reschedule your appointment’. So now, Apple is trying to convince ppl you don’t need a replacement battery or you can wait until the end of the year to get it. If you do decide to wait, be sure to give yourself 2-3 months advance time in case they give you the run around. Obviously Apple had made a big enough mess that they’ll need about an entire year to clean up their mess.

I took it in the apple store and they replaced the battery, along with the display (it had a few scratches) and the keyboard, trackpad, and top cover. All for free. I was in shock. In fact, it's basically like a brand new computer (on the outside). I was going to replace it fairly soon but now I'm happy to keep using it for another couple of years at least.
cie_B	OneWorld™	2018-01-14T23:00:00Z	1	RIP off. They not only slow down your phone but also didn’t  even explain why they do it until they was caught. I have a iPhone 7 Plus and I will not be upgrading any time soon. I’ll just replace my battery. My Apple mouse for which I had to pay extra keeps breaking and by breaks I don’t mean physical damage but software. The macOS has serious flaws where your passwords if kept in Apple Keychain are vulnerable to hackers.The iOS 11 is the most half baked product ever.iPhone X starts at whooping £999 and if you drop it and are unfortunate enough to break the back glass you’ll have to pay £549 if out of warranty.The new iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X cost so much yet if you want to fast charge them you have to pay an extra £40-60 to get the right charger. One would imagine that at such prices they will include all the necessary accessories but nooo.It is true when they agreed is a curse but for this company it seems to be working in their favour.
cie_B	M.	2018-01-14T23:00:00Z	1	When buying a new phone for myself, my kids convinced me to buy an iPhone (I have a work IPhone and haven't particularly liked it). I have my kids phones/ipods on the same ID. It took me around 3 h if not more with customer service (over the phone) to partially fix the problem of my phone pulling all my daughter's data. I was told to create separate ID's and create family sharing on icloud, but nobody told me that this solution comes at the cost of $15/month. As my family is already buying music on I-tunes and paying additional $15/month for sad choice of music doesn't seem economically prudent... I was told that's how apple does it... I simply started turning off access to I-cloud - hopefully that will solve my problem...Out of 4 Apple people I dealt with this issue with, 2 had patience and interest in helping me (but didn't resolve the issue), 2 were disappointingly arrogant (and still didn't resolve my issue). Total waste of time. I'll see if I can return the phone. Totally disappointing experience.

After the account is created I go to download messenger for Facebook. Mind you I have TWO iPhones the 6splus and 7plus both phones are the ones with most storage. Then it says my account is locked for security purposes then a link to UNLOCK MY ACCOUNT pops up, I click it, then it takes me to reset my password so I reset it. Then try downloading the app again, same thing happens. All this one done on the 6. And get this, I downloaded a FREE game on the 7 then I need to put In a credit card number in. For a free game, really? So I do but it’s one that’s prepaid and has $2 left on it and it says I need a valid card, basically with more money to scam me? I don’t think so apple. DEFINITELY SWITCHING TO SAMSUNG!!! Oh and then I heard something about them slowing down the older phones so people would buy the new ones so I googled it and found a video of them apologizing about it. Haha 😂 definitely no longer team iPhone. Im sure they have more than enough money made to survive and now they wanna be cheap. Goodbye 👋🏽

The iPod would have been exchanged to a brand new iPod nano 7th Generation, instead I was left with nothing.On December 2016 I returned my iPod with Apples partner UPS , they did damage the return shipment and contacted Apple about this - Apple did nothing, not even contact me.I have contacted Apple as many times I can remember since 2017 to 2018 but without getting my old iPod or exchanged for a new.Because of a manufacture fault in the battery the iPod 1th generation was recalled, making the iPod dangerous to use. The battery can burst in fire and cause serous damage to body and property. The iPod would have been exchanged to a brand new iPod nano 7th Generation, instead I was left with nothing.I have been in contact with Apple many times. What I can tell is that they lie a lot, all that fancy talking on phone is a facade. When they cant help you they try to give you hard to /impossible tasks, in my case it was a purchase receipt for a 10 year old device. And after giving them the purchase receipt they just say, no we have never told you we want a purchase receipt. The customer support will sometimes say ""I will send you my contact details to you on email"" but sometimes they never do, so making all that hassle of contact them again and explain everything to a new person.Because of this I have spoke with many people on Apple. Everything goes, lies, to reading paragraph to paragraph from terms(not even applicable on my case)and also blaming me for the error of UPS. I will go forward and contact Swedish police about my case.They just take resources and energy from you."
cie_B	JP	2018-01-10T23:00:00Z	1	I had 2 apple ipods, both of which failed within 2 months of the expiry of the warranty.  Apple blamed my use of them but years later an insider told me they knew the batteries had issues.We used iTunes but when my wife died Apple told me that she had leased them for life and they could not be passed on.   This despite us paying to download and use each track and nothing about this stated openly.My daughter used a MacBook which died on her losing a pile of information.  Apple wanted a huge amount to resurrect it.  As it's a hybrid operating system only Apple can do this.Then we had the fiasco when Apple refused to unlock a terrorist's cell phone for the FBI.  Now we have the fiasco over the slowed down phones!Apple charge 60% margin on products while the norm is 30%.  They avoid paying taxes, they keep money offshore and do not make any significant charitable donations.They developed some ground breaking things like iPad and iPhone but have exploited their customers with high prices, deceit and arrogance.Why pay a premium for such a brand when Android does the same, arguably better? Or if PC use Microsoft.

Each time I was given incomplete information by an employee. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, the temperature was well below zero AND THERE IS NO PARKING WITHIN 6 BLOCKS.  Because I also have Reynaud's I almost got frostbite.  Once you reach the street you have to walk at least a half block to get to the front door.

I could type an entire text message before the words popped up on the screen it was so slow then, the OS totally shut my phone down. It would not turn on anymore, just the"" charge iphone"" icon would pop up but wouldn't turn on even when plugged in or left to charge for hours.

I am undoubtedly moving to PC so that I can do the things I need to get done without having to pay out the pooper for products that will become obsolete soon after purchasing them. Now that I have said that, hear this as well. I have not been able to login to my itunes for who knows why? because my password is incorrect? That is impossible since I use so many logins I write them ALL down with paper and pen and keep them in my safe next to my imac in my office so this does not happen. I cant use my iphone on my macbook until apple discovers my login info even though I know what it is and they know damn well they are trying to force me to change it.  Apple uses this tactic to get you to go onto their online store and view more of their products. SHADY SHADY SHADY! Over it."

cie_B	Graham Biggs	2018-01-07T23:00:00Z	1	I purchased my iPhone X from Apple online everything was fine with the delivery and the phone was well packed. However on inspection of the new phone there were 2 flaws in the stainless steel band around the phone. (so much for apple quality control)I phoned Apple and they insisted i sent the phone back where it would be replaced, however it would probably have been a week before i got a replacement, not good enough they should have organized a replacement and collection. in the end i had to go to the Apple Store in Kingston to get it replaced. Kingston is a nightmare with traffic and parking. The store were helpful and agreed the phone was not acceptable, and they were happy to replace it. In the past when i purchased anything from Apple it was absolutely pristine, so you can imagine how disappointed i was with my new phone with two chunks out of the stainless band in fact it looked like someone had tried to prise the phone apart with a knife. I doubt i would buy from apple direct again.

Apple says nothing can be done. So its of no use at all now. Yes i did loose my details for the ipad. But many people do. So ipad is stuck on activation lock now and no good. Customer support did not want to know or help. I will never buy an apple product again

Held for 30min after speaking to a machine and finally got thru but to another foreign language speaking machine and was cut off. First I called Wembley store then I tried the Brent Cross and it was the similar process and the phone call was cut. Appalling service.

Everything that Jobs worked and died for is being systematically reduced to cow dung. Consumer confidence has pretty much dwindled down to nothing by 2018. Apple thinks that by discounting the cost of a replacement battery will pacify the lies told for many years. When I took my iPhone 3, 4s, and 6 and complained about slow performance, the employees were trained to explain that there were no issues with the phone and then yoselling me on a new phone or battery.  So what about the cost of constantly upgrading and paying for a new phone that now I realize I never needed??? Apple takes thousands of my dollars over a period of nearly a decade and they want to apologize by offering a $50 discount to remedy the problem? What a joke! I spit on your measly little offer. If you were really sorry you’d offer them for nearly FREE!!! I think that shows the sincerity of your apology. I for one will never buy another Apple product again unless Steve Jobs himself comes back for the QC. Until then, sorry your mega company that you built with your blood sweat and tears is being reduced to an embarring debacle, Steve. Maybe it’s better that you’re not here this see this mess your trusted team has created.
cie_B	Andrew Adcock	2018-01-04T23:00:00Z	2	Whilst the staff are competent and you are given the attention required initially, I must say that behind the facade it is difficult to get a straight answer, solution, phone number or email. Honestly, how hard is it to give a stores direct contact details?I've been sent around the houses and it will take 5 months to get a new battery for my laptop. Not what you expect from the premium Apple.
cie_B	Bill Stewart	2018-01-04T23:00:00Z	1	I have just wasted over 40 minutes having a 'chat' with their service (they should look up the definition of this word) department before I finally drew the session to an end because I was fast losing the will to live. They just COULD NOT care less about the customer. To them we are just cash cows to be milked regularly. I WILL NOT buy another Apple product (and I say that as I scan the room beside me and more the Mac, two iPads and two iPhones, and I have an iPod somewhere too).

cie_B	Lise Rok	2018-01-02T23:00:00Z	1	What’s your definition of a premium sport watch? Biometric data collection, Apps, long battery?  How about the face and back of the watch staying attached?  I bought my generation 1 Apple Watch a year ago- the back fell off within 3 months. The second watch: the front screen fell off. Third watch- back fell off. Technicians certify no abusive damage to the watch. I don't even take it in the shower. Forget running, ice climbing, kayaking or skiing.Apple's Solution? Wait for the next break. It seems Apple really takes care of it’s people- but only after it breaks FOUR TIMES.

cie_B	Ian MacLaren	2018-01-01T23:00:00Z	1	After speaking with 3-4 customer service members over a month, I have just given up as I have got nowhere with any of them. Most of them insisted that I needed to order iPhone x but today I was told to just go to store. After travelling over 20 miles to Cambridge on Monday 1/1/18 checked google and website and it said store was open) Second attempt today and was happy I was able to do with finance (upgrade programme) but after completing credit info/ accept Ts & Cs , the young man selected decline instead of accept and then it came straight back saying I was not accepted for programme. Now, I know I have done everything correct my end, but I feel the staff were just too hasty to make a sale and made errors, the young whipper snapper must have only been about 15 and quickly got another colleague to back him up saying there is no error on Apple part. How could he know?  Did he see all information I input?After I gave all correct info to Apple Store in Cambridge, they said it could be a number of things, but they tried to say it's nothing to do with Apple, I need to go direct with Barclays or third party who did credit check. I checked all of these, none of which helped and all seemed to blame each other or me for not having a good credit score (how do they know my credit score!?) NEVER AGAIN!!! DO NOT WASTE TIME with APPLE !!! they are timewasters, dishonest, unhelpful, unfriendly and complete S*** I have a good credit score, of course they just don't want to give phone on interest free finance, they prefer to sell it for £999 or with high APR % robbing hits

cie_B	Pinehill Inn	2017-12-30T23:00:00Z	1	Our family has been using Apple for years. My 6S was acting slower and slower so I contacted support. They offer a $29 battery replace but need me to go into a store (too far away) or mail it in and I cannot be without the device that long. For a large percentage of customers there is no third option. Very short sighted and poorly handled.Time to leave Apple, hello Samsung.
cie_B	Denise Rogers	2017-12-29T23:00:00Z	1	I have been an apple customer exclusive since the iphone came out. With that being said I don't buy a phone every time one comes out but I have been loyal to apple. Now my less than 2 year old phone is slower than any phone on the market and will not stay charged. I had it looked at to be sure I wasn't missing something that was turned on that shouldn't be and they didn't find anything.  I don't appreciate Apple selling me a product and advertising its speed and how great the product is only to take that back from me to try and force me to upgrade. That is like selling me something and stealing it back! I feel its a slap in the face for you to offer me a batter at a discount as if the battery on the phone had anything to do with this. My phone was fine until your changes. We have 3 phones total in our house hold and all the phones were affected at the same time. I thought about this a long time and I wanted to make it known that I wont be buying apple anymore. You may bully some people into buying a new phone but as for me and my family we will join Samsung family.
cie_B	Gavin	2017-12-28T23:00:00Z	1	The recent news about Apple manipulating customers equipment came just in time, My wife was about to go and buy a iphone, so that's saves us a few quid. My cousin was about to buy Apple computors for her two daughters, so she saved more than a few quid. Apple has gone pear-shaped, nothing more than a Fat controller dictating to the public.
cie_B	Zach Howell	2017-12-28T23:00:00Z	2	I have been an iPhone user for the past 7 years and finally decided to purchase another Apple product because I like the simplicity of the phones OS. Well, after looking at a few tablets I settled on the 10.5 inch iPad Pro at $1,400 out the door with the Apple Pencil. I’ve had it for a few months now and the majority of the experience has been OK, the rest has been pure disappointment. It is slow in all areas, unresponsive at times, freezes, doesn’t rotate the screen most of the time unless flipped back and forth. The camera is pretty good, but I still question why the camera from the iPhone 7 Plus was not a standard option on the iPad Pro as well. I’m now ready for a new phone and there’s no way in hell I am going with another Apple product, instead I will be making the switch to the Google Pixel 2 at half the price and way better reviews. See ya Apple!

The childs mother set the passwords on her i phone and on her ipad, as any responsible parent would do, her mother has DIED earlier this year, no one else knows these passwords, this child has the same illness as her mother and has a pump fitted to her body keeping her alive, feeding her the drugs that keep her heart pumping.She cannot do the same things as other kids her age, these are all she has, the family do not have a great amount of money and cannot replace them, and Apple......dont care, i am disgusted, i know they must deal with fraud and stolen phones etc all the time, but these facts are checkable, as long as they keep their profits eh guys. My daughter in law is the sister of this child, and this has upset the whole family, Unbelievable
cie_B	Gloria Galan	2017-12-26T23:00:00Z	1	On November 29, 2017 I visited the APPLE STORE at the DOMAIN AUSTIN TEXAS as my IPHONE 6S touch screen was not functioning. After a two hour wait one of the Geniuses came over and twisted the phone and the screen worked for a few minutes.He advised someone would help me shortly. After another one hour wait another Genius finally assisted and ran tests finally after “eyeballing” the phone he advised it would be replaced for $148.99 claiming the phone had been dropped. I advised it had not ant I had researched Apple IPHONE 6S and Apple was aware of issues with the 6S touch screen.  He gave me no choice so I agreed to pay and was advised I would have my replacement in 5-7 business days.  It has been almost a month and I still don’t have my replacement.  APPLE when is my replacement going to arrive- please don’t tell me in 5-7 business days like your Genius did when I called to check on the delay.   Your customer service needs serious improvement.

After spending so much of money on my iPhone I was really upset to see my phone like this please do resolve these problems.
cie_B	Gregory Mikat	2017-12-24T23:00:00Z	1	All Apple services and content are money traps with hidden fees and automatic billing.  It's easy to access and try and buy their content, but if you make a mistake, forget to cancel or just want to stop Apple from taking your money, watch out!  It literally took me hours to figure out what some of these bills were for.  Especially concerning was connecting by phone to an Apple rep who was unwilling to explain my charges and actually said she lacked authority to stop billing.
cie_B	Tar	2017-12-23T23:00:00Z	1	Our ipad slowed down and began behaving strangely immediately after a firmware update. A friend told us that we shouldn’t have accepted the firmware as many now know this is where your troubles begin.I have been up and down these isles in the company of friends using iphones and have never ceased to marvel at how my antique Blackberry gets a signal where their phone does not. And my friends may or may not be tech saavy, but not one of them appears to have much understanding of their phone. Frequently baffled.My ipod? Always hated the device. I miss my old Sony Walkman. You bought it, put whatever batteries you wanted into it and away you went. No software upgrades, no computer required and sound quality EASILY as good if not better, for all the inconvenience of cassettes.The Apple watch? You’d have to be a moron to even consider it, so in thrall to Apples marketing machine that you are now no more than a drone.Finally my 5k mac was very expensive for what it is (£2000) and although the display IS terrific, the rest of it is scarcely any better than the previous desktop mac. And I have noticed ALL my Macs began slowing down after the first year or two; What makes this interesting is that I use them exclusively for photography - never connected to the web except for software updates, not loaded with foreign software etc yet still these machines slowed down significantly, often to the point of unusability, even after defragging and reinstallation of software.When I next require a tablet or computer I will definitely NOT just go sheep-like to the Apple store.Finally, I would point out that we are paying for our own surveillance. It is probably already too late to do anything about that and you have to admire the sheer genius that has foisted this stuff on us - the digital equivalent of the one, true ring.

cie_B	Emily	2017-12-23T23:00:00Z	1	Apple is very rapidly losing customers' trust. The media stories about Apple slowing down older iPhones absolutely has had an impact on this, but also it seems like the customer service representatives are following some sort of scheme to misinform customers. My phone is having a software issue with Safari. I contacted Apple several times to resolve this issue, and both times the advice was the same: use strategies to save battery life and make a software update. Honestly it did not even seem like the staff even bothered thinking about what could be causing the issue and just made cookie cutter suggestions probably passed down by the Apple management. I did not think the software update would fix my particular issue, but I after multiple people told me to do so I caved and made the update. GUESS WHAT my phone is still malfunctioning and now it is now SLOWER as well. I am convinced these people told me to download the software update to play along with Apple's game of planned obsolescence, and unfortunately I fell for it.I used to rave about Apple products and was never disappointed by the service I received. Recently, it seems like Apple is going downhill. My Mac and iPhone are both up for upgrading and I'm not sure if I will choose Apple anymore...
cie_B	Eman Zokari	2017-12-21T23:00:00Z	1	Very horrible customer service I had a replacement the same month I bought my iPhone 7 Plus and I still have issues with it I called many times and get out on hold for hours and when someone does answer I get put on hold for another while and hang up in my face again. Then I call the supervisor several times to complain but still no help this  is all BS I’m never buying Apple products again.thanks a lot  for bad customer service And wasting my time
cie_B	Nathan Channon	2017-12-21T23:00:00Z	1	Their chosen delivery service for a £4,000 order was terrible. DPD - delviered to wrong address, signature not even close to my name - and won't process any kind of investigation/refund/replacement for 4 working days over Christmas. Got empty-handed children on Christmas day now. Brilliant.They wouldn't even agree to collect the wrongly delivered parcel as a return so I could go and collect replacements from the store to ensure we had presents.Who the hell sends out a £4,000 order with DPD!????
cie_B	Harry smith	2017-12-20T23:00:00Z	4	Have been a big fan of apple for a long time. I still think they are offering great products, and have recently upgraded. Just think they need to sort out the cost of storage.
cie_B	Tracy Vazquez	2017-12-20T23:00:00Z	1	I purchased Beats in October 2016 and they broke in December of 2016.  I contacted the place that I purchased them and they referred me to Apple stating that the Beats come with an Apple warranty of one year.  I contacted Apple and they were great.  The sent out a box pre paid shipping label and we returned the Beats and promptly received a REPLACEMENT paid.  We receive that paid on in January of 2017.  In December of 2017 the replacement paid broke.  I once again called Apple and was advised that they are not covered under warranty any longer due to the warranty expiring in 90 days for the replacement Beats.  I reviewed warranty information on Apple's wed site and it appears to me that the Beats should have a full year warranty since they are not a year old yet.  I called Apple again and was told that the replacement paid only has a 90 day warranty I said that makes no sense since they did not repair them...they replaced them.  They said even if the took into consideration the original paid that broke in two months were under warranty that warranty expired in September/October 2017.   How kind of Apple to stand behind there replacement Beats by offering to repair them (they don't really repair them they replace them for a cost to me of $199.95 plus $6.95 for shipping and handling which I was advised by the App rep that is still a good deal since they cost more than that in the stores currently.  No it is not a good deal please stand behind your product and cover the replacement of your replacement Beats within a year.  Horrible Customer Service experience and incorrect information given during phone call number one so a second phone call was required and my issue is I am still an owner of a pair of Beats that are not one year old and are broken.

I'm guessing I will get the hang up again soon.  how apple service ever gets rated more then pathetic is amazing."
cie_B	Marissa N	2017-12-18T23:00:00Z	1	Let me start this by saying that I had no problem with the Customer Service associated with Apple, but as you can't leave reviews of their products on their site, I had to find another source.I am an avid Apple person - have been using Macs for the last 6 years and have had an iPhone since 2011. That being said, the Macbook 12-inch laptop is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had the displeasure of using. I bought the laptop brand new in July of 2016, and now in December of 2017 it has been rendered completely useless and I've been told I need to spend $575 to send it in for repairs. Should I have gotten Apple Care? Yes, and I will take responsibility for assuming the best in the product I spent $1,200 on. Should I have had to assume that after a year and a half of use, the computer I bought brand new would self-destruct internally? No. I'm not talking a display error. I'm talking full-on processor has shut down, and my computer cannot even start. A brand new computer that can't last longer than a year and a half? Also keep in mind that I use this computer for online shopping and Microsoft Office - that's it. This computer is garbage, and I find it LUDICROUS that I'm expected to pay $575 for repair on something that is not even slightly my fault. If I had dropped it or spilled water all over it or lit it on fire - sure, I'll take responsibility there. You should reconsider your repair process or you'll lose loyal customers. Also - try making a better product. I should be able to rely on something for at least two years.

cie_B	Gary Mason	2017-12-14T23:00:00Z	1	Absolutely shocking customer service.  This is the WORST company I have ever dealt with for customer service.  If you aren't talking to a machine, you're talking to someone in California, or Portugal, or Ireland.  This company does not know how to deal with customers.  I have now got rid of my iMac, my iPhone and my MacBook as I simply can't rely on Apple.  They do not stand by their products and leave you stranded when you need help.  I am not a complainer, indeed, I will praise where it's appropriate but my word, these are BAD.  Think carefully before buying Apple - this, by the way is not an isolated experience, this is the fourth time!!
cie_B	Sue Maitland	2017-12-14T23:00:00Z	1	I have tried to reserve an iPhone upgrade on the website for 2 hours but when I get to the end of the process and press CONFIRM  it states something is wrong please try later. I rang Apple and the guy that answered the phone said it was no problem I could reserve over the phone and would put me through to the store. I asked for the Arndale  centre Manchester and he put me through to the Trafford Centre ! They gave me the number for Arndale and I called them. A lady answered advised me that I could not reserve over the phone. After advising her of the issues I had experienced on the website she advised me there was nothing wrong with the website.  I have just tried again via a different device and am getting the same error message to try later. So much for their technology!!!
cie_B	Iqbal Khan	2017-12-13T23:00:00Z	1	Apple got my post code wrong and coupled with this the delivery company had the package but refused to deliver.  I had to make many call to the apple store locally where I bought the two iPhone x. Only to find out that the package had gone missing at the delivery company's depot.  When the phones were ordered end of October, I was advised that delivery will be within a week, it was about six weeks and then the package went missing at their delivery company's Depot.  Its taken many phone calls and email and a further five weeks for the phones to arrive.  Customer service at Apple when things go wrong sucks.

Closed Apple store 70 miles away. Bowling Green doesn’t have Apple store???? One month explanation to 100 supervisors. Finally they sent to me new phone with same problem. Unbelievable! 2 hours phone conversation they sent new phone but charge me $598 pending money if I won’t send back old phone. I’ve sent back old phone in same day when received new one. Second week I cannot get my money back. I can’t believe in it! Next time, NO Apple , only Samsung

And then when ur on an app the phone will close the apps you have open and make you go back into them. Also while texting people they won’t get some of your messages and some with phone calls. Very dumb. After I pay this phone off I’m going to Samsung
cie_B	Chet	2017-12-09T23:00:00Z	1	Wow what a hash of a company.Used to purchase many Apple products and was a complete fan. Not any more, most recently purchased 2 of the latest Macbook Pro with Touch Bar models and they are rubbish. More like a MS Windows machine with constant nonsense. Most recently it updated to High Sierra and ruined everything! Thank goodness I had a backup and restored to the previous OS.What a typical greedy USA company which churns out absolute crap.One thing always puzzled me; how did these companies get so rich? Simple I guess when you charge additional taxes for a product and then never pay them back! Thank goodness for our great politicians!
cie_B	Chris	2017-12-08T23:00:00Z	1	I’ve had a lot of Apple products over the years and it was always great. The past couple years my frustrations have grown. I bought a brand new IMac and it’s never worked right, I always get an error when turning it on, everyday! I called a couple times and their response was “you don’t leave your car on overnight” when I said if the computer remains idle for more than a few hours, really?!  My work computer never turns off and works great still (PC)My iPhones always seem to glitching out on me or not working correctly. Screen won’t work in which the “genius” says to grab each corner and “straighten” the phone back out because they tend to get a little “off” at times. These are just two examples. I could go on about how they build their products to obsolescence or no longer stand by their products, instead they want you to buy the newest model. Never buying Apple again unless they change their priorities from money back to the customers.

Waited over 1.5 hr post my collection time just to be served by depot. Immediately told that the package is not there. This is despite confirming that I should come to Collect. Then Apple took over. I have been a customer since the I pod launched in 2004. Was told they will launch an investigation and call me within 2 days. No one called. When I called back myself i was told it will take another 48 hours. I wanted to speak to the manager and now holding on over 1 hour. They have held my money for over a week now. DPD lost the product and I am being punished for this. I still love apple products but it goes to show how a company can treat you when you actually need the help. I have lost a whole morning of work plus all the time chasing up apple. I have also ticked the option to state that I am happy for Apple to be forwarded this message.

This is my 5th iPhone and was planning on buying the iPhone X, but not anymore.  I have their Apple TV, watch, iPad.  It does not matter to them that I am a loyal customer.  All that matters to them is if you have Apple care or not.  I will never buy another Apple product again and am going to be selling everyone that I have now.  Do not buy their product.

cie_B	Larry	2017-12-04T23:00:00Z	1	"Worst company ever. I bought a MacBook Pro in 2010. Problems from the very beginning. Serviced in Apple Store 2012 and 2014. started exhibiting spontaneous shut downs (all reports went to apple). Stated calling support in 2015, failures got more frequent, and apple never id'd the problem. Been demanding they ID problem, I replaced HD and maxed ram at their suggestion, no help. Failures keep happening even when on the phone with support. No one ever sited problem from support until about 2 weeks ago when the tier 2 specialist told me the engineers said the logic board is heading toward imminent failure. I called MAC Sales and spoke to Jason who asked me ""did they ever tell you your machine was recalled for these problems?"" I was shocked to say the least that no one in all this time ever suggested that. They had opportunities to fix the problems (known component issues) but they strung me along. Ever tried calling corporate? good luck if you do, they just keep shuffling you around expecting at some point you will give up. I told them they have a bad rep and they don't care. I finally got thru to corporate customer service and they just tried to push me back to support. Can't imagine the nightmares iPhone users have. Don't trust this company for anything. I'll be filing with AG tomorrow, likely BBB as well."

On hold for an hour and in the end the customer service agent was clueless and told me to wait for a senior advisor, another 30min later she told me she couldn’t help. Incompetent personnel  and unacceptable wait times
cie_B	Tyffani Cox	2017-12-03T23:00:00Z	1	Their customer support is a joke!  Why even have customer support when they d ont or can't even help you?  The person I talked to declined letting me speak to anyone and wouldn't even give me her employee number so I could file a complaint on her non- educated butt.  My son is missing out on his school work because of their non-helping ignorant butts.  Don't ever call them thinking they will resolve any issues or help you, because they won't. I only have 1 star to wrote this review, they deserve no stars.  Not to mention their new IOS 11 is a joke, has too many bugs, makes phones shut off and freeze up for no reason at all, even on the iPhone 8
cie_B	Marina Johnson	2017-11-30T23:00:00Z	1	"Apple played the ""bait and switch"" game. Last week, I ordered a phone at apple.com on Black Friday. The promotion was for a $50 Apple gift card with purchase of the phone. When I did not receive my gift card, I called 1-800-my-apple. I was told that if I bought the phone with no sim-card (no attachment to my wireless provider), I would have received my gift card, but since I already have a wireless provider for my phone number, I do not qualify for the gift card promotion. At no point while ordering the phone was it mentioned that I should not attach the purchase to my provider in order to qualify for the promotion; In-fact, quite the opposite, when purchasing the phone, the step-by-step process required me to select my current wireless provider. RIP OFF!! Never trust an Apple promotion!"
cie_B	ammie emery	2017-11-30T23:00:00Z	1	I am so unhappy with apple I wish I would have never switched from android. I have been waiting 5 days for instructions to be sent to my phone to change the password to my 11 year old daughters apple id . Since she is 11 and doesn't remember it . Today 12/1/17 is the 5th day the system said in 38 minutes my instructions would be sent to me I waited an hour went back and checked only to fond it changed to 3 day wait . This is absolutely insane no one in customer service wants to help you . I got treated like I was thief and it wasn't even my phone. Pretty sure apple just lost customers . I will be going back to android since apple only wants your money and could care less about helping its customers.
cie_B	wendy	2017-11-30T23:00:00Z	1	Horrible customer service. Registered my phone to someone else. Couldn't spell my name right. Can't get my phone number right after multiple attempts. Refuse to fix my defective product after stalling for 3 weeks and now claim I altered my phone in some way in the 2 months I've had it. Spent over 6-7 hours with tech support uninstalling and reinstalling programs on my computer trying to fix my phone before they would admit there may be a problem. Non-existent customer service.
cie_B	Erland	2017-11-29T23:00:00Z	2	Ordered from Apple.com; sent me a product in a box that had obviously been opened, even though it was sold as new. One of the wire-ties were undone, and the product had lint and a dust on it.

cie_B	Daimler Betancourt	2017-11-28T23:00:00Z	1	Apple's technological advance is going to a decline in accessories quality. Now Macbook Pro laptops do not have a USB port or HDMI, so you are forced to spend $ 70 more on acquiring a device to use these accessories that are vital for the daily use of a common laptop, and those should be a part of it. On the oder hand, talking about  the new charger !!! Have you noticed how bad quality? It looks like the charger of a phone, The magnetized advance that had the previous version was incredible! Now it has not. Nither the led indicator. Also the charger no longer has the handles that were made  to roll up the cable.  Seen the charger, you realize that it will be working  just for a few months. So you have to buy another and another...
cie_B	JEAN	2017-11-28T23:00:00Z	1	Accountability of customer service reps. Doubt they document issues and just are too lazy to remedy. They just transfer your from rep to rep and none of them end up doing anything to solve the problem that is caused by the apple product. I actually took a shower, washed my hair and styled my hair while on hold for 1.5 hours. The final transfer was as useless as the other 3. A total waste of my time and energy.

cie_B	Charlotte Greenway	2017-11-27T23:00:00Z	3	"I get it. I once had a job that involved answering phone calls from the general public, and I understand it takes time. So I waited forever to ask a simple question - ""can I get an apple watch engraved"" - because I could not find a clear answer anywhere online. When I finally get through to a representative, she asks if it's a question related to a personal Apple watch, or something business-related, to which I responded ""personal"" and asked my question. She said, ""hold on, let me just check for you,"" and click. Call ended. Which I understand sometimes happens by accident, except I must have been one of the last callers around the time the phones were rolled for the night (I had originally started calling during business hours), because when I tried calling back, I was told all offices were closed and to call back at a better time. Coincidence? If you can't spend time speaking to each customer that comes through after you roll your phones, at least try rolling your phones earlier so we don't have to wait a stupid amount of time for no  answer. I love Apple, but this was a huge turn off."
cie_B	Tom Watson	2017-11-26T23:00:00Z	1	[Visited Solihull Touchwood store]For a start, if you take your device into an Apple store, you can almost completely disregard your appointment time. Mine was for 10:10am (for iPhone screen repair), by 10:35 I was actually seen to. Despite what seemed like hundreds of staff, getting service in there is very difficult! You’ll see a gaggle of staff all talking to each other, rather than approaching customers - and I was standing right at the Genius Bar desk waiting. In the end I had to collar someone. So when my phone was finally taken from me for repair, they told me to return at 12:30 to collect it. Being unaware that I’d have to kill two hours, I strolled bored around the town centre and having run out things to do, returned to the store at about 12:20. I asked about the progress on my phone and they said it’s almost done and will be down in about five minutes. So I told them I’d just loiter around the shop. By 12:45, still nothing. So I waited for another 5 minutes - and they said it’s on its way down. By 13:05 they finally brought my phone out to me.My phone screen was fixed, but the rest of the ‘experience’ was awful. Before now I’ve never ever even so much as scratched a phone - but if it happens again, I’m probably not going to an official store.
cie_B	Renaraya	2017-11-25T23:00:00Z	1	Customer service is absolutely terrible. I asked a question about an older iPhone and to reset settings on it and was told by this rude jerk that it would cost me 40 US to reset. I repeated what he said and basically asked if I was deaf, I told him he was rude and he hung up on me. Called back and was hung up on again. Total crap service, and a complete lack of respect wow garbage. I hope Apple records these convos, so they review and fix these problem employees.
cie_B	vivijan maric	2017-11-24T23:00:00Z	1	I been a user of Apple products for 10years and I never complained but now I have to, I am really disappointed because I broke a little bit the screen of the IPod nano 6th generation from my manager and Apple told me that because has 5years they don’t fix it anymore, after 5years they don’t carry anymore the pieces to fix products over 5years but they sell new ones so I can buy a new one!!?!Are you seriously?Not everybody can buy new items all the time!You should have always pieces to fix unless one store in the whole USA should be in charge of that!!!
cie_B	Yu Minghua	2017-11-24T23:00:00Z	4	I've just recently started using a Macbook pro and so far I'm really happy about it. The speed is amazing, the UI is easy to navigate. The only issue with the new generation is the absence of proper USB ports, or any usable ports overall. No HDMI, no micro card, nothing. I really do not want to buy a ton of dongles just to have a sleek design.
cie_B	Rocco Petrucci	2017-11-22T23:00:00Z	1	Pathetic customer service.Was contacted via email to notify me that the repair of my laptop was complete. Drove 30 mins out to the store to collect it only to be informed that the works were not complete. I was furious for wasting my time. When I asked that they compensate me for the time wasted I received a reply that I would need to talk to their legal department. Pathetic customer service.
cie_B	David	2017-11-21T23:00:00Z	3	Still love my 6s plus more. Facial recognition is near and works well. Music quality is better. I take lots of photos, hate the new format and cannot see an appreciable difference in photo or display quality. The much touted portrait mode is a real meh. If you knew how to use the older cameras properly, there is no difference. Data transfer worked better than older models but the phone doe not proliferate my pictures across my Apple ID, a really bad situation. I have a setup session booked which may fix this, well see. Would not make this purchase again.

cie_B	Stephen K Kavanagh	2017-11-20T23:00:00Z	1	I spent the majority of my day trying to order an iPhone 8 and 13-inch MacBook Pro for pickup the next day at a nearby Apple Store.  It was a nightmare from the start.  First, Apple was using a credit card they have on file for me that I can’t see.  It isn’t part of any account I can access and for some reason, my order wasn’t allowed to be seen by my account.  I used Apple Pay to pay for the order - which I’ve successfully used at many non-Apple vendors, as recently as a few days earlier.  The customer service people kept saying “I’m sorry you’re having a bad experience” so often that it was perfunctory.  They did NOTHING useful to resolve the primary issue (with the order) or the underlying issue (with the account or credit cards being used).  I ended up canceling the MacBook Pro because it was not going to be delivered in time for my pickup because I upgraded to 16 GB of memory.  I wasn’t told this would delay the order or asked if this was acceptable.  Oh and they also changed the color from silver (on the previous online order)to space gray.At no time did the service person review the order with me.I spent probably 8 phone calls (not including numerous drops) and at least 8 hours on this order.  One service person, sent me a follow up email with her phone number and extension, but never returned two separate calls with voice messages, even though they were hours before her shift ended.Apple just doesn’t give a damn and neither do their people.I was also going to try to upgrade my iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone X, but that’s not going to happen now and for the first time in 25+ years of buying Apple products, I’m going to take a long hard look at an Android phone.I am very reluctant to reward bad Apple service.Stephen

cie_B	stephen	2017-11-15T23:00:00Z	1	Really poor - bought I phone 6 (six hundred and fifty quids worth) in 2015. Went wrong (bottom speaker nacked up) and they replaced it reluctantly free of charge. 9 months later the top speaker on the replacement phone ain't working. Went in today 16/11/17 (Newcastle Eldon Square branch) - they refused point blank (well the store manager did) to replace phone and tried to charge me £45 to fix the speaker - despite acknowledging that the phone was in pristine condition and and the likelihood is that it would have been a production based fault. Pathetic - but then again this is a company that had £190billion hidden away in a jersey bank account in order to avoid tax. Says it all about their 'moral' compass.

Waiting times are absurd for replacement devices on Applecare +.  No real cate for customers or to make customers happy when there device fails and no getting a better model either when they don't sell your old iPad pro.
cie_B	Alan Burnia Jr	2017-11-14T23:00:00Z	5	Recently my iPhone 7+ flew off of my motorcycle while I was doing about 75 mph on the freeway.  I pulled over to fetch my phone expecting the worst. I figured that it would be destroyed from that type of fall.  I found my phone and surprisingly it was in tact.  The case fell off and it suffered some scratches however the phone is working perfectly and the glass did not crack.  BIG PLUG for Apple here, I'm impressed.  Unfortunately I dropped it again getting out of my truck, and it's surviving on it's last leg.  I've had iPhone's since the 3 came out, and will continue on Team Apple.  I wish I could afford a new iPhone but I'll have to buys a used one for now.  Great Job Apple.  I will continue to convert friends from droid to apple.

I've recently had the need to borrow my Dad's iMac, which must be about 6/7 years old. It needed wiping and the software re-installing. After having issues doing this on my own I had to call Apple, bearing in mind the warranty is long expired - I've got to say I've just had the absolute best customer service ever from an advisor called Lauren Owen, she bent over backwards and now I've got a 7 year old iMac that works like new with the new software! All at 8:15am!! You can't get better than that. After that ill defitnely be moving back to Apple for all of my tech.

They do everything they can to keep you away from exposing your needs and resolving them.

Now they say they'll be taking my laptop away for 5 days, when you're a student and your own business that's not exactly ideal. I'd just like to clarify, that this is an issue with Apple's software and if that's. It incvonvenice enough they're going to take 5 days to fix it when I leave on business tomorrow. Shocking customer care, apauling staff and an even worse product.

This is completely unfair or unlawful business they are doing.Till date none of the Apple team have come out to say this. If they are so true to their customers why is it taking so long for them to tell about the defects in latest IOS versions.Why is IOS update made so mandatory for everyone if they are not interested, this forceful updates need to be stopped. If apple enforces the IOS updates make sure there are no defects or take responsibility for the issues.

cie_B	Valarie Hill	2017-11-02T23:00:00Z	1	I purchase Powerbeats 3 4 months ago within that time I've had two issues with them the power went off and did not return on until I sent it back in to Apple. Apple sent me back my original headphones. Two months later my headphone earpiece fell off. I did nothing negligent to have the head the earpiece fall off, when I called Apple they said there was nothing that they could do for me and I would have to pay $100 to get them repaired. I am under warranty I spent $200 for my headphones and it's very frustrating that I would have to pay half the price that I originally spent on them to get them repaired. The representative name Jessica that I spoke with would not let me speak to anyone else and she kept refusing that I speak with anyone else about my issue. I'm not the kind of person that spends a lot of money on electronics I thought when I bought this brand of headphones that I will get my money's worth and I did not, I would have to spend $300 for a pair of headphones that should be good quality but it's not. And to have a warranty and get no results is mind-blowing. Apple sucks and all they care about is getting money from their customers I will never buy another Apple product ever again.

cie_B	Kes Vel	2017-11-01T23:00:00Z	1	"My iPhone 7 plus still under warranty after updated 11.1 software the phone is dead and contacted the service and they are unable to recover any data on the phone and asked to contact third party service to recover using my own money. Even market MOST EXPENSIVE SMART PHONE but VERY WORST ONE and advertised the best phone which is not correct. Apple support is very poor and they are the worst one. Applications stops working all of a sudden and iPhone goes in "" Comma mode"". iPhone has done 3 more updates ( 11.0.3) after the initial iOS 11 but all failed to remove the bug. Shame on you - Apple, one side you harp about best technology and other side your software updates are worst in the industry. Apple should compensate me for the loss of data and other customer's lost soon else be ready to loose a big market share. Time has come when people are realising that iPhone is not worth the cost and its a useless product."

Unfortunately I disposed of the dangerous/faulty one and ordered and paid for a new one from Apple before realising it was a common fault. Apple support aren't interested as without the faulty cable they refuse to refund my money. They have all the order details and accept I purchased a new cable from them but its tough luck. Its my first Apple product and definitely my last. Spent ages online chatting and then on the phone without any success. It appears once they have your cash they couldn't give a damn. Avoid Apple at all costs not what I expected after spending 2k. It would have been no stars if possible.

Apple seems have lost it. iPhone don't deserve the price tag they carrying. iOS 11 update has been a big mistake, after the update iPhone hangs atleast 10 times a day. Applications stops working all of a sudden and iPhone goes in "" Comma mode"". iPhone has done 3 more updates ( 11.0.3) after the initial iOS 11 but all failed to remove the bug. Battery dies within 2-3 hours after a full charge. One need to carry charger everywhere. If you don't carry a charger then better leave the iPhone at home as you can't rely on such a filthy product. Shame on you - Apple, one side you harp about best technology and other side your software updates are worst in the industry.

However, on a few occasions now, I've had to deal with Apple's customer service department and they're absolutely awful! If you have any problems with products that you buy from Apple, just accept the problem and move on, because they won't help you. I've had issues with an iPod shuffle, iPhone 7 plus (which has broken WiFi) and a more recent accessories order. If you want to make a claim under warranty they don't answer you and (if they do) they charge an extortionate amount of money for a repair. Their products are already expensive, but add £155 for a broken screen and a reconditioned replacement, rather than an actual repair, and you've got a situation where you're reconsidering why you ever purchased anything from them. They're just such a huge company that they simply don't care about their customers. Once you fall into their marketing ploys and purchase an extortionately overpriced product from them, that's it; you're on your own. So, save yourselves the trouble and DON'T USE APPLE. You can't even cancel an order. Once it's been placed; that's it!!!
cie_B	Rodney	2017-10-28T22:00:00Z	1	I went to preorder the iPhone X at 3AM ET and I ended up with a reservation number and an email confirmation of the reservation. Eight hours later at noon I got an email with a link to proceed with my order using my confirmation number and phone number. When I went to the link and put in my stuff I got an error that they could find my reservation. After several times of trying I called apple and they said are having problems with the server not responding and to try again on a regular basis and it should work. I did that exact thing and when it didn't work for a couple of hours I called back just to get the same answer. I repeated this process another time before I went to bed. The next day I tried to proceed with the order using the link again every 10 minutes until the reservation had expired (starting from when I woke up (9:30AM) until about 3PM). Keep in mind that I would call Apple support every hour on this day and every time I got the same answer, keep trying and eventually our server will work. Even though for the most part the apple operators were fairly nice, this never worked for me and then once I was within the hour of my reservation cancelling I asked for management, was on hold for 30min and then got hung up on. When I called again it was after my reservation time had expired and when I talked with apple operators they acted like they could not help. They said I would have to place another order and be put in the back of the line. How could they do that when the problem was their servers in the first place!!!!!! I could not believe they could not give me an extension for my reservation or keep true to my delivery date. This is truly disappointing to me and I am a loyal apple customer and have an iPhone, iPad and mac. This may not be true after this dilemma, absolutely terrible customer service knowledge and no accountability for their mistake, at least fess up for the wrong you did and get me an iPhone X that does not have a 5-6 week delivery date. I AM EXCEPTIONALLY ANGRY AT APPLE RIGHT NOW AND WILL MOST LIKELY NEVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS BROKEN ACCOUNTABILITY, I DO NOT TRUST THEM ANYMORE.
cie_B	Rajgagan Sran	2017-10-27T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy iPads, Because apple is selling ipads with software which stops IPads to connect with any cellular network ( displaying no service) once warranty period expires. This thing happened to me twice.I have iPad which is 3 years old. Well looked after, always in case, no scratch at all. I asked if it is because of software why do not you fix it or  replace it, they said we do not ,because you had this for more than warranty period. So I strongly recommend my friends, apple fans, be mindful before you buy if you are spending money for up to warranty period only. Thanks

cie_B	Samantha Romberger	2017-10-25T22:00:00Z	5	Although there is a wide variety of media streamers available today, it all comes down to three main things that you should look for into finding the right one. These three things are the apps and streaming services available, the resolution, and the design of the device. Apple TV greatly fills in these main factors with the best option available, and this is why Apple TV is the best media streamer to buy to this date. I personally have an Apple TV and I believe that it is the best media streamer available. It has not disappointed me once, and I believe no other media streamer would be able to offer the type of technology Apple TV offers.

cie_B	Mark Saville	2017-10-24T22:00:00Z	1	"I have an immaculate i phone 7 which has the well documented issue of the home button failing, the ""touch home button"" was new for this phone and if you look at the forums there are many cases of this issue occurring.  My button has a chip on the edge so Apple say this is neglect yet my phone is perfect and the button is recessed and it is always in a case with a glass protector applied.  I am not paying for a repair just because a component was not designed robustly enough. I am currently in talks with trading Standards as their belief is the phone is not ""fit for purpose"" and their exclusion clause can be challenged  Apple keep ringing me when I push them to and  ""reach out to me"" as they keep repeating saying along with  ""my expectations were set too high""  I never had an issue with the button on my last 5 Samsungs!  Twice I have been sent in to  separate stores by the helpline however once there you get a form NO!  they state Operator Error, Apple come on  implement your discretion process and  repair my button.  I advise anyone to go to Trading Standards as there is enough evidence out there and they say we have a very strong case.  Small Claims court is cost effective and Apple cannot claim their costs back under this process.   The issue is with Apple you don't get to speak to the business people who can make a common sense judgement and a commercial decision until you push very hard. Once Apple acknowledge the fault and replace my screen I will consider amending this review.   This issue may affect your future I phone  and you will waste days of your life through no fault of your own"

WHY NOT VERIFY USING EMAIL? WHY NOT MAKE THE SERIAL NUMBER WRITTEN IN LARGE LETTERS? don't understand why apple products are so popular!!!

I was asked to email a copy of the proof of purchase and they would contact me within 2 days, they didn't so I rang the helpline again to be told, they couldn't accept the receipt as it was a photo taken from the computer and needed to be a photo of a paper copy, so I sent them a photo of a paper copy waited no one contacted me so rang again only to be told they couldn't accept it as it didn't have the serial number on it and to write the serial no on the proof of purchase and send back, which I did! Today received an email from Apple saying as its not the original receipt they can't help!😡 So after 5 weeks of being messed around Ive just ordered a Samsung Galaxy Tablet! Thanks Apple🖕
cie_B	Simon Atlas	2017-10-09T22:00:00Z	1	i bought a mac book pro 2 years ago, not even 6 months later the mac won't turn on. I go to the Apple Store, they tell me there is a fabrication default on everything inside my mac, still they change the components (logical board, fan, everything!) but not the mac itself. Today, 1 year after that, the mac won't turn on again. Same scenario, I go to the Apple Store, they tell me I have to change the logical board (which is the price of a new mac) but my warranty has expired... 2 logical boards to change in two years, is this normal? I always took care of my laptop, they assured me at the store that the incident is not my fault, it must be a fabrication default, but since I don't have warranty anymore, they won't do anything for me. 1500 euros for a device that lasts two years, brilliant Apple! What a bad quality and you are not even capable to assume your mistakes. Customer service is not what it used to be. Very disappointed.
cie_B	Giles	2017-10-09T22:00:00Z	1	The phones are good in isolation but Apple try and make you pay for extra services constantly, keep pushing them and if you do subscribe make it almost impossible to go through complex steps to cancel. Worst is the App Store, music and icloud. It took me 45 minutes to work out how to undo subscriptions. Music often wont load if not bought from itunes! Apple support is out of date constantly as they change the steps so often. They make amazing phones but Apple have become a nasty cynical money making machine and do not make things best for the customer.

cie_B	Jim Meyer	2017-10-05T22:00:00Z	1	When I went to load some more nice ring tones on my iPhone 6 Plus today, I worked for hours trying to get ring tones on my phone I got for free from Zedge Ringtones for iPhone. After exhausting everything I have done in the past to get the tones on the device, I called Apple iTunes support where the rep advised me that the IOS 11.0.0 was intentionally designed to eliminate the ability of it's customers from putting ring tones on their phones that they got or purchased from another site or store other than Apple iTunes. That's a darn shame. I will no longer be an advocate for Apple going forward. That's just messed up guys. You should be working to fix all the bugs IOS 11 has. Tons of them, such as the severe battery drain issue I still have since 11 and have even replaced the battery. The phone has been reset and wiped completely - started as new. several  Apple employees at the Apple store agree it is a software issue not including the nice lady in Apple tech support over the phone. Instead of Apple becoming more friendly and nice to it's customers  they are selfish, rude and just are just trying to PO their customers for pulling the ringtone / iTunes store stunt all for only a few dollars.

cie_B	Alex Marszalek	2017-10-01T22:00:00Z	1	I am having an issue with intermittent charging of my device and an error message saying ‘this accessory may not be supprted popping up’. I have it on a range of different chargers and even my 3.5mm to lightening bolt connector.My phone was replaced by apple 3 weeks ago due to an issue with the battery life on my previous device. So, i decided to take my device back into store to have it looked at.The genius i spoke to said that there was a lot of dirt in the connector which i was a little less than convinced about due to the phone being so old but i went with it and accepted it as an answer. (Note- my new phone has a smashed screen). The genius did however say that even though this was probably the issue, his manager advised that they would replace the phone for the cost of a new screen. I was confused that he even mentioned this to me as he told me the dirt he removed was probably the issue?I told him i was not prepared to pay for the screen replacement and went on my way.I got home and yet again, when plugged into various chargers, my phone continued to have this  error message and so i could not charge my phone overnight as it would randomly stop during the night.I decided to go back to the store to discuss what had happened. I told the genius in the store of my issues and he stressed that the phone is ‘out of warranty’ due to the smashed screen. I told him that i did not want a screen replacement but i wanted a phone that charged properly. He told me he could not fulfill my request so i asked to speak to somebody that could do this. He told me he was a senior technician and they do not have the power to do this.As i continued to try and reason with him, even though he agreed with what i was saying in that, replacing the screen does not affect the charger, and so to ask me to pay for a replacement screen was an unreasonable request, he could not change the warranty policy details. He then told me that he was very busy and due to the long queue was not prepared to continue conversation with me and told me to call AppleCare to escalate my issue. He once again agreed that i had a fair point in not paying for the screen replacement however he could not help.I left the store and called AppleCare where a very efficient call centre worker quickly forwarded me to his manager as he knew he could not help me with my issue. After waiting for a few minutes, i was put on to a lady working for AppleCare and despite explaining my story she also told me she could not help and that my request was unreasonable as the phone was ‘out of warranty’. After about 10 minutes on the phone to the lady, she asked me if i was nearby to the store i had been in (which i was) and if i was able to put her on to the Genius bar representative that i had spoken to earlier. After waiting for around a further 10 minutes he eventually spoke to her and they finally arrived at the agreement to get me to speak with the branch manager of the store i was in.My issue was explained by the genius representative and the store manager continued to tell me about how ‘we don’t get into the ifs and buts with the customer’ as it causes confusions. I asked him a simple question, ‘Of i buy a car and it is in warranty and there is an issue with the engine but it has a cracked windscreen, does the car dealer tell me that they will not complete the repair work on the engine until i pay for a windscreen replacement?’ , he replied with ‘I don’t know about that as i am not a car dealer.’. I asked him a further question, ‘does scratched and dents of the casing of the Iphone also classed as ‘accidental damage’? ‘ he replied with ‘yes’. So i asked him why they replaced my other iphone 7 two weeks ago, he told me he could not talk about the previous device.I asked him if i was to pay for the screen replacement, would they actually replace the screen? He said no, but that the phone would simply be recycled.I told him that it seems as though apple are aware that there are issues with their phones, however, when they know they need to replace their phones, they try to squeeze every last penny out of you by putting in place biased and unrealistic warranty guidelines. It is not my fault that apple designed their phones in such a way that they cannot replace parts in them. I simply expect to spend £719 on a phone that does one simple thing, and that is charge.I am extremely disappointed with Apple’s Customer Service, this is unacceptable behaviour from such a large, influential company.
cie_B	Elena Volkova	2017-10-01T22:00:00Z	1	Terrible, terrible service in Apple IPad. I called just right now and this terrible woman with who I spoke helped me with my problem in IPad, but how she did that.... All the time she gave me a feeling than I am stupid and can understand  specific terminology in IPad. Most then that she all the time let me know she couldn't understand me because I am second language speaker. I am working in customer service industry and I know how to treat people. How she spoke it is impassible!  She was so snobby! I think huge company like Apple can really find much better employee than she is.

cie_B	Josh	2017-09-30T22:00:00Z	1	It appears the first time you ever purchase a iPhone you are instructed to encrypt your backup.  This morning I backed up my iPhone 6 to upgrade to iPhone 8 plus.  Never once in the backup process did it prompt me of a password or encryption.  When I go to restore this backup i created I no longer have access to it.  Apparently over a decade ago I set a password that will FOREVER depict my life in terms of backups.  I google this to find atleast 3600 people also had the same issue.  I call apple to hear, yes, this has been an issue for some time.  How in the hell do you not add a prompt into the system letting us know that you should A create a new password or B go without one?  This is an absolute disgrace by apple.  The data i have lost from texts alone is invaluable.  I work as a freelance technician in the motion picture industry.  The new clients reaching out to me and the data surrounding that is invaluable.  The amount of money I will lose by trusting apple with this type of information will cost me my next few weeks of work.  Apple has known about this issue for years and has chosen to do nothing.  They made a choice not to correct it.  This is a deal breaker, congrats apple you've lost a client for life.

cie_B	Melissa	2017-09-28T22:00:00Z	1	Update: After what I wrote below I realized they had blocked my apple ID so I had to call them back up. At that point I gave my whole story again and she offered to refund all of it. I told her I did not want it all refunded. Just what I did not purchase which was the two charges of $4.99. At that point she said well just let it go through your CC company. you have already started that process. I could not believe this whole experience. Have been playing a game on my phone and I authorized two charges. Well the game charged me two additional times. I called Apple and after being told by the CSR I would be getting a refund she transferred me to a Senior IT support gentleman. He wanted me either to admit I did an accidental purchase for a onetime refund or file a police report for the $9.98 charge and then I would have to wait for my refund. I told him that I was not going to admit to something I had not done, especially after telling me it was purchased during the hours I was at work. I then told him the CSR already told me she would refund it and was told she did not feel comfortable with this and passed me to him. I asked to speak to a manager and was told they do not speak to customers and he is the highest they come with manager approval. I hung up and contacted my credit card company. I canceled my credit card because I don't want the app to continue charging me. It was $4.99 for each charge and they want to fight me on that. Unbelievable.

I can’t load any of my photos on iCloud as it has kicked me out. After spending an hour on the phone to apple customer service, which beforehand was a nightmare to get through because I was forced to speak to a robot and use the website to answer my questions, which may I add is lazy customer service. After this hour on the phone, my problems are still not resolved and basically left with a broken phone. Very disappointing. Would not recommend apple to anyone.

I dropped it off at the local store and now I haven't seen or heard anything about it for 2 months, except for the fact that it's made its way to apple's repair centre.

I should have received a working device - repaired or new - long ago and am really dissatisfied with apple's overal support.

Especially the drag and drop feature supported by many apps...People are astonished when they ask me when I bought this and I tell them 2011! It's often faster than higher spec'd machines on the Windows market!Just so you know, I am a programmer and have used Windows, Linux, and recently MacOS. I would not go back to windows ever!!Would highly recommend the products, even though they are a bit expensive, they are really worth it!!!

cie_B	Dietrich Busacker	2017-09-14T22:00:00Z	1	"Inacceptable Customer support, We have 2 new Macbook Pro 2016 were the keyboards don't work propoerlly. The problem is well known as contruction problem in the Net and any car comoany would make a call back and replace the keyboard (Apple has developed new key borads to solve the problem in the mean time)  To repair them, they need 5 days plus for each Mac meaning interruption of 5 days+ of work each time. Is there any solution like giving us at least one Mac to be able to work in the meantime? (ou old PC don't support the new software anymore) ""No, Apple support doesn't provide for that"" Is there  any good will solution Apple can provide? ""No, we can't"" (or better we don't want to. We don't care about our customers) PC company would allow itself such a bad service. Poor Steve Job will turn over in his grave - we'll go back to Microsoft"

I called apple support 2 people tried to scam me, the one i gave access to my computer he pulled up notes NOTES and wrote down name number email address and date of birth and asked me to fill it in umm?? Really next the person asked me for my credit card for a 30$ customer support fee!!!!! and through all this i could barley understand a word they said. Also Apple needs to fix things major thing i imposed pictures from my mac a while ago and i can't delete them from my phone i have to go through all this to delete pictures!!! The pictures are still on my phone my problem has not gotten resolved. I did get an American guy help me and he lead me to some of the pictures i wanted to delete but not all of them?? People import pictures but they don't want to keep them forever apple needs to change this where you can just delete them off your phone and not go through all this stuff i have always been an apple person but I'm so disappointed this is ridiculus
cie_B	Echo Chavez	2017-09-10T22:00:00Z	1	I bought a apple iPhone 7+ in red and ever since the 1st day my speaker had issues ppl said I sounded muffled and would cut in and out. So I call apple and they say to take it to a iphone store but we don't have one where I live. So instead I had to go to a retailer and they wanted to charge me 149.00 for a phone that was bad out the box and I was already payin 900 for so I said nope not gonna happen. So I call apple again and they said well you have insurance best thing is to file a claim and I'm like why would I pay 250 for a replacement phone for a phone that was bad out of the box that's your job to replace it because of the 1 year warranty but nope. I hate apple wish I would have waited for the note 8.
cie_B	Kashif Arshed	2017-09-08T22:00:00Z	1	Apple has no intentions to provide a decent customer service experience. They deliberately under staff customer service professionals and the customer end up either waiting for over 4 hours (that's half a working day!) or get an appointment 10 days later to have some look at your Apple product (after waiting 30 mins on the phone).Absolutely ridiculous!I for one will be switching to Samsung the minute my contract is over!
cie_B	Disappointed	2017-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Why does Apple continue to abuse its loyal customer base?Apple laptops continue to rise in cost year after year and their customer base continues to pay the price.  Meanwhile the company balance sheet has over 1 Trillion dollars in cash.  Why not give it back to their loyal followers and entice others along the way.New MacPro (small screen 128 gig) over $1600 all in - terrible price - the apple zombies eat it up.  These loyalists have all bent the knee to the apple night king.
cie_B	Robert	2017-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I used to like Apple a lot then one day I ended up with two Apple Id's and It's been hell ever since. Customer service won't help or can't help at all . The problem is that every time i connect to apple they want a new apple ID so I have to go through all the hoops of forgotten password re-enstating and more security questions and changing passwords because you can't reuse you original pass word. I'm frankly sick and tired spending an hour every time I want to get an up date or an app. Apple , you really dropped the ball on this one and don't expect me to buy another Mac Book Pro either. This nonsense has been going on for over ten years now and I've had enough. I'm not even going to get the big iPhone seven next month. I'll get a galaxy note. This iPhone 5s Ive been using for the last week has been giving me nothing but grief also. Apple is nothing but a BOT to me. !!

cie_B	David Matthews	2017-08-31T22:00:00Z	1	Apple has turned sour.  Ripped off from buying a free app with stupid unexpected in-app purchases.  Never putting credit card details in again to prevent being ripped off again.  Won't let me download a free app because of so called verification that requires my card details.  Never again.  Selling all apple products and going elsewhere before the value drops to a sour level.
cie_B	Carl Brandt	2017-08-31T22:00:00Z	1	Purchased an iphone7.  3 months later it froze up.  Sent it off to apple after many hours on the phone with a tech.  It was sent back stating that it had been modified and warranty was void.  Argued with them for 2 weeks and they offered to send me another phone for $400.I purchased insurance for this phone, and when they were contacted, they said that I had to go through apple because the phone was still under warranty.A week later I contacted apple support at 1-844-399-9866 and 1-844-813-8225.  They told me that they could replace the phone, but my old phone was hacked and they needed to obtain $100 from i-tunes to protect the new phone from known hackers.  Like a dummy, I did this.  They then told me that I need to give them $1200 because the $100 only covered the hackers in California, and the additional money would cover other hackers from Texas. Watch out.

They asked us to wait 24 hrs for them to fix it, which they did. The staff were polite & patient. I am not good on devices or computers but they talked me through it step by step and made sure I was happy before ending the call. Well done apple and well done staff - your time and patience are very much appreciated Thank you

cie_B	Jae Weaver	2017-08-24T22:00:00Z	1	I bought an apple iPhone 7 a few months ago. Everything was okay until I realized there had been money missing from my bank account, I immediately called tech support and they told me that there was a pending $300 to be taken off of my card from apple within the next two days. They supposedly had no way to stop it and they told me that somebody had hacked in my Apple ID and gained access to EVERYTHING. The man proceeded to tell me that the person who had hacked my stuff was posting my pictures on pornographic websites, which I found odd as I have no nude photos. I continuously asked them to stop the pending $300 and to give me the $15 that was taken out back, they refused and kept telling me there was nothing they could do about it unless I spent $100 for a more secure Apple ID which would only cover me for a year? What the **** Apple?
cie_B	Gord McNeill	2017-08-23T22:00:00Z	1	"I have been dicked around by Apple for almost a month now. My phone is in activation lock and I have been told I will receive a link and code to unlock it on 2 separate occasions this month, none of which came. This came from a ""Senior Advisor"" I suppose I should add. I tried account recovery again, and now I've been told I have to wait another 2 weeks to receive info they have already failed to deliver twice. I'll also add I'm paying for apps and cloud storage I can't access and use. I am done with Apple no matter how this turns out."
cie_B	Hazel Galvez	2017-08-21T22:00:00Z	1	I think that apple products are good and if you do your research you can find something good for you. But what happen to me should have been acceptable for a company like them. When I gave them my laptop for repair they told me it have been water damaged and that they would just close it up and give it back to me as it was when I gave it to them which was working. When I get it back the laptop no longer works. So I take it back to ask them if they could fix it. They now tell me that the laptop it no longer usable and that I should just buy a new one. They are crazy why would I buy I new when I gave it to them it was working and now it's not. I went once a again to ask to give it back to me they way I gave it to them and they said no because it not possible. They are the ones who broke it and they wanna blame it on something else.
cie_B	Gordon Musch	2017-08-21T22:00:00Z	2	Apple support is the main reasn I am moving over to Samsung.  Although their products look beautiful I find their ever increasing complexity of hardware and software a detriment to their products.  But what really matters is the level and qualification of their support people currently.  I have been presented with conflicting answers to the same issue.  After screen sharing with them new issues arise and the old issue is still not fixed.  I have had support people who can not even understand the problem and have to ask others for advise while I am on hold.  The level of knowledge amongst support is very variable.  For what these devices cost I expect them to work and get seamless support.  I do not expect perfection, the devices are very complicated.  But it seems the right hand is not talking to the left.  And for 4 times what a similar laptop would cost I expect support.  Another issue is the absolute complexity of their web site support pages.  I have counted 5 ways to get in touch with support, and all have different web pages.  Their CHAT while using proper grammar and language gives really poor advice.  ALWAYS talk to a person.  ALWAYS.   Another thing to watch our for is when they update the OS.  Their eco-system is so compliocated and inter-connected it creates ripples throughout your entire computer.  Sometimes very subtle, others not so subtle.  For a cost benefit analysis they are just to expensive to justify anymore.
cie_B	MissWilliamston	2017-08-20T22:00:00Z	1	"Sent my 4th generation iPad in for a cracked screen.  Apple allowed me to do this without any WARNING: ""Are you sure you want to do this?""""If we no longer carry your device, you will never see it again.""Never got my 4th generation iPad back. Went through FOUR Senior Advisors.  Not one of them told me or directed me to the page of the Terms and Agreements.  I received a device in return that I couldn't use because it was much smaller than my current 2 Smart Cases.  I didn't want it.  Just because Apple doesn't care about the environment, doesn't mean the rest of us don't.  I'm not putting my perfectly good Smart Cases in the landfill, just because Apple wants to be Corporate Bullies and FORCE you to upgrade to something that you don't want.One Senior Advisor that I spoke to said, ""That has never happened before."" ""You only sent it in for a cracked screen.""I work work in health care.  I wonder how Apple's CEO would like it if his mother, spouse, child or any other relative went into surgery for a simple procedure and came out DEAD and the surgeon told them, ""This has never happened before. Such a simple procedure.""And 4 weeks later told them they failed to read the fine print on the surgical release form.Or if the wrong body part was removed, but that's o.k. Here's a replacement prosthetic part. It's not the same, but we'll throw in a new pair of shoes, and you can throw the old shoes in the trash.We will also give you a $150.00 dollars off your next bill as compensation.(Which of course, I never got as promised as a credit to my Apple user account.)I have only and always been an Apple user.  It is time to cut the umbilical cord, because Steve (RIP) can't be brought back to revive his company he worked so hard for."
cie_B	Michael Voice	2017-08-20T22:00:00Z	1	I am based in Dundee and use a single Apple laptop for work and home use.  It has needed two repairs (one covered by Apple) however the only option is to send it away through the Dundee reseller (2 weeks wait) or drive to Aberdeen from Dundee to drop it off and the go back a couple of days later to collect it.  Used to use a local repair service but with new product Apple won't let them have the parts.  Apple abusing a monopoly they created to ensure their own service providers do the work.  I can't in all honesty recommend Apple to anyone who relies on their computer and lives more than a few miles away from a repair centre because, if anything needs to be fixed, they have a lot of driving in store.

And the customer service is almost always very helpful on the phone or at the Apple Store. But, sometimes it can be a very long wait to see someone at the store. I also found the support website hard to navigate and not always useful in the end.

cie_B	Sabrina Clark	2017-08-16T22:00:00Z	1	I bought an iphone 6 in December 2015 and the phone developped issues and was replaced by the Meadowhall storeThe iphone was replaced by Apple back in December 2016.The iphone developed further issues and was taken to the shop on Sunday 13 AugustA member of staff attempted to run a diagnostic of the phone but was unable to do so as the phone wouldn't allow it for some reason. She  therefore stated that there was indeed an issue with the iphone which could be either a display or hardware issue and that it would cost me to have it repaired. Without my knowledge, the member of staff listed the fault as a display issue (despite not even being able to run a diagnostic.I highlighted that as it was a new phone which Apple had supplied me, I should be covered under the Consumer law ActI also spoke to the manager who was quite dismissive and stated that she was unclear about consumer lawWe therefore contacted the Apple head office who booked another appointment with the Apple store. I attended the appointment and was fist told that there were no issues with my phone as these were only intermittent. However, after strong insistence, the member of staff finally agreed that there were issues with the firmware (and not with the display as previously recorded by the other member of staff)  and that only Apple could fix this. However, I was told since the phone was not bought from the Apple shop I was told that I had to contact the original seller. I contacted the original seller who was out of trade. I was advised by someone (including an Apple member of staff that as the new mobile provider, Apple should be able to fix the new device. I am now left with a phone which does not respond most of the time and no one seems to accept responsibility for it. I have been given different conflicting advice on each of my visits / online contacts. I felt that I was turning round and round in circle.The customer service is completely scripted, nonexistent and the manager / one of the member of staff I spoke to was completely clueless and totally rude.

So basically apple is telling me they know they have a defect in their iPhone 6 Plus and instead of recalling the phone and replacing it for the dedicated customers like myself they instead let us keep them and break and then make more money off us by charging us $150 on top of the $900 we paid for the phone for a problem that is apples only!!For a company as big as apple I fill this is just a pure example of how much apple truly appreciates their customers.If it's your problem ""own it"" yet instead they choose to rip us off more.Bad business and I won't let it stand! I will make sure every person I know understands how Apple runs their business and how much they care about the customers that made them rich to begin with.Without us Apple you are nothing don't forget that my name is Luke Spalding"

I need it now and there only Idea is for me to re purchase everything that my sons and her purchased if needed till THEY can work it out on their end. My wife locked her self out of her account due to the fact she could not remember any of the answers to the security questions due to her CANCER. This is such a helpful company. NOT. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE i am locked out of my account because i can not remember the questions I had and they will not re set the security questions. I set this account up 12 years ago . And have not used it since I went through cancer 7 years ago and stoped working out . I refuse to by any other Apple products once my kids are out of school . They are totally un helpful and the customer service blows

The problem relates to blue tooth communication between my phone and my car entertainment system.  The system used to work correctly but following a software update they now do not communicate with each other.  Older and new models of IPhone work fine.  I understand that this problem is not uncommon.  Very poor service and assistance.  Obviously Apple's Engineers have more important issues to deal with.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.

A few months ago I started noticing a steep decline in power and today the Apple Watch lasted only 12 hrs, from 100% to dead 0%. I Tried to talk to somebody genius in willow brook mall Apple store last Saturday with such a bad luck after one and a half hours waiting one of the ‘associates’ told me I have to wait another hour because the geniuses where a little behind schedule, I gave up. Later on I felt optimistic and contacted Apple support via chat, I explained the situation and went over all strategies I have applied to enhance battery life, such as eliminating unnecessary notifications and location services, the support person told me I was doing all he would recommend and advised me to unpair the Watch and restore it from backup. I did, but the result is the same!, frustrated I left my dead Watch on the nightstand. Don’t know what to do, it cost me a fortune and now is pretty much useless!

I will clean the Smart Cover and the iPad weekly to avoid dust. However, after a few months, probably 4-5 months, I just realized that the Smart Cover will scratch my iPad, I contacted Apple Support and they said they will not provide any repair or replacement as this is considered my own fault. I told them definitely is not my fault as the Smart Cover and the Silicone Case cover the entire iPad up, how can it be scratched? Later on, a Senior Advisor told me that it is considered as Normal Wear and Tear when using a Smart Cover. I was really annoyed, thus, now I took the risk, I left my iPad aside for a week without touching it, and yesterday, I realized that the number of scratched increased. This is the proof that the Smart Cover will scratch the iPad, as I didn't use my iPad at all for the entire week! Besides, if your Smart Cover will scratch the iPad, please mentioned in your website, just like the Jet Black iPhone 7.

I request for an exchange last Friday, 28th July 2017Today, received the new exchange macbook, however this time to my horror,the new macbook seems perfect with a dent. I paid so much yet I settling with this nonsense from the prestigious Apple.Apple service is getting bad. They wasted me three weeks of my time and effort in backup. Even worse, the Apple online shop appears to be based in Malaysia warehouse. I keep receiving their packaging with label for Malaysia and even their service card is Malaysia address. It appear to be a refurbished laptops if you happen to see label for KUALA LUMPUR.After my today with bad service experience receiving from Apple, I am not confident in Apple after being their fans for so many years. I will never purchase anything from Apple online store ever again. Please be aware and cautious if you are purchasing from this big giant. Business practice is not right and does ahold to their reputation of producing best quality laptops unlike previous years.

cie_B	Clare Brace	2017-07-24T22:00:00Z	1	Purchased an Apple Mac online, delivery was a shambles. I appreciate Apple use a 3rd party, DPD in this instance but thats their choice, not mine.1. Friday, Item ordered. Originally given no alternative delivery dates when ordering online.Only had Monday as an option.2. Saturday, received a text to tell me delivery was going to be made. It was a Saturday and I wasn't at work to receive the delivery.3. Attempted to change the delivery address with Apple, they couldn't.4. Opted to have the item delivered to a collection point to stop the delivery arriving at my work which wasn't ever something I wanted but as I have no alternative delivery dates when I was ordering, I was stuck.5. DPD acknowledge the change of delivery via Text.6. Monday, the items are delivered to an unknown person at my employer's address. BUT I'm notified by DPD the items were delivered to the collection point.7. Visit collection point, they don't have the item.8. Items are now missing, 9. Contact apple via chat and phone every day for 5 days, every time I get a different story as to where the items were and what would happen next.10. Eventually on day 5, a manager calls me. Apple take no responsibility  for DPD's terrible delivery and have told me I'm  a victim of crime as the item was signed for at the location by someone I don't know! They take no responsibility for failing to deliver to the agreed location.11. I have no mac!!!!12. Solicitor has advised small claims court for Apples failure to deliver the package without due care.Literally the most incompetent online service I have experienced in many many years. Absolutely appalling service.

So they can not provide me the warranty...... they all thiefs. Every time they change there view on my problem. Every time they give me different views...never buy any apple product
cie_B	Dhr. Schakel	2017-07-23T22:00:00Z	5	Purchased a couple of products this year. An iMac, accessories like additional band for the iWatch, iPad pro keyboard. And my iPhone 7 fell on the ground, this time on an unfortunate angle and breaking (partly scattered) the front screen.Delivery; excellent - well packaged/protected, good tracking/tracing information and on time and as scheduled and reported.Repair; very friendly customer service, fast redirect to a linked service company (Card service). Repair was priced on the high side, but the phone is as new! No scratches, no repair marks. In short --> simply Apple (=excellent) standard. I just ordered the AirPods, but need to wait due to current out of stock situation, but surely it will be okay in September.
cie_B	Richard	2017-07-19T22:00:00Z	1	"Last year I bought a 27"" imac and it did not work. I was on the support line for hours then Apple suggested I return it. The second imac did not work either. They suggested I return it.This time, as they were suggesting the fault was mine because of the way I backed up time machine data to the new computer, I requested the third 27"" imac be opened at the mac store. A senior technician at Brent Cross London took the imac out of the box.This third imac did not work either.  The senior technician at the mac store then altered something on the imac and said, 'if you get this home and it does not work, I will eat my hat.' I took it home, turned it on, and it did not work.The issue in each case was a lack of bluetooth connectivity, i.e. the mouse and keyboard did not work. Throughout this entire process I spent 40 hours on the mac technical support line and many of the technicians gave me contradictory advice/suggestions.Since then, I have been using my old 2011 imac that stops me working, everything is asking to force quit. It is a nightmare. Their machines are not built to last anymore.Last week I ordered a 21"" imac and was required to wait in all day for delivery as the UPS did not give an am or pm indication of delivery. they merely stated it would be delivered before 6pm.At 5.40, om 19th July 2017  I called UPS and Apple as I had not received the imac. At around 6pm I logged into the USP update site and it was written that a delivery was attempted at 16:38 and that there was no-one there to take delivery. My doorbell is very loud and it never rang. I had been in all day. There was no card left for me by UPS, which is what they should have done if they had made a delivery. They made no delivery.I contacted UPS and they offered to drop the imac the next day at a collection point so I would be able to pick it up at my leisure.The next day, 20th July 2017, I was about to leave home when I got a call from UPS to say they would no longer be able to do this, as apple do not allow high value items to be left in these places, so I had to stay in.I then stayed in for the rest of the day and did not receive the imac. Apple then email me around 5pm to say that UPS would now be delivering that day to the collection point after all, so I stayed in all day a second time for no reason.Later that day, 20th July 2017 UPS phoned me to say my imac was too big to be dropped at the collection point and that a delivery would attempted at my home on 21st July.Thus, a situation had been orchestrated whereby I had been forced to stay at home for three whole days on 19th, 20th, and 21st July due to the total incompetence of UPS.The next day, a manager at UPS said my imac had not been delivered the previous day as it had been loaded on the wrong van. This was a totally different excuse.The imac was delivered late on 21st July 2017 and when I told the USP man what I had experienced he started laughing, which did not impress me. He then grew aggressive and abusive, shouted and screamed at me  and then snatched the imac, and drove away with it. It arrived on the morning of 24 July 2017. I looked at the box and it was covered in stains, and had several dents, broken cardboard, scrape marks. It looked like it had been thrown about severely, and been round the world about five times. I wrote to a senior manager at Apple but how they seem to do business, is that they never seem to put anything in writing. Last year,  I received nothing from them about the three 27"" imacs that were faulty. All they do is allow you to speak to their staff on the phone. The fact that they offer to replace any item within 14 days, gives them the opportunity to put you through hell in any customer service situation and you are able to do nothing about it other than get your money back."

cie_B	Linda	2017-07-17T22:00:00Z	1	Having spent £800+ on the latest iphone 7 plus, I find that it has a faulty microphone and noone can hear me! Apple support cannot fix it remotely so the phone needs to be sent away for repair. They say it will take 7 - 10 days and they refuse to provide a loan phone in the meantime. I now simply want them to refund so that I can purchase a decent phone....but no -  toing and froing with Apple support has taken me over their 14 day refund period. To add insult to injury, having spent hours on phone and chat support, an Apple 'customer service' rep swore and put the phone down on me. Their unanimous suggestion is that my carrier should provide me with a loan phone - unbelievable as I bought the phone direct from Apple and my carrier has absolutely nothing to do with the problem!
cie_B	Victoria S.	2017-07-16T22:00:00Z	1	"I made a horrible mistake. I ordered a refurbished macbook pro from apple directly. It arrived broken. The fancy new function bar wasn't functioning, as in it had no back light so there was no way to know where any of the keys were. Despite the assurances that they check refurbished items top to bottom, it was clear that this machine hadn't even been turned on, or if it was, they didn't care.Apple support was useless but did set me up an appointment with the ""genius"" bar. So far, apple had wasted about 4 hours of my time. The geniuses took another hour out of my life. After waiting 15 minutes for a preset appointment (not too bad I'll grant you), the guy took one look at my computer and said it was broken. He then offered to replace it with a brand new mac (joy!) that had half the ram, a slower processor, but the same amount of storage. Apple, I've got to tell you, the ram and processor are the computer now, no one cares about the storage space. I explained that half the ram was not acceptable and they told me that the only computer they had with 16 gb ram was double the storage and therefore $800 more. I offered to split the difference with them and reminded them that they had sent me the broken machine, not the other way around. They said nothing doing but did offer to give me a refund on a gift card and help me use their website to order a different computer. Thanks, I am not a child and I can use the internet on my own. So I got a full refund and am looking into a fancy new pc. Apple sent me a broken machine and offered to fix it by giving me a less powerful replacement. No one apologized on the phone or in the store. They are a complete waste of time and a massive disappointment. This company used to be worth the absurdly extra price, but no more. Save yourself the hassle and check out anybody else! It can't be worse than these folks."

cie_B	Serge Pierrache	2017-07-16T22:00:00Z	3	I bought from Apple online store an Apple iPad Pro 10.5 with Pencil and Smart Keyboard. The edge of the keyboard showed a gap between the table and the keyboard itself.At first I thought it was just a matter of time before it would 'set' to a normal position. After a month it still didn't.Today I contacted Apple online service and that was a disaster. After 43 minutes I just ended the conversation as it was becoming a ridiculous call. At first I got a nice service guy who was helpful but after a while I was transferred to his supervisor who treated me as if I should deal with the matter myself: make an appointment with the Apple Store in Brussels and then drive there myself. I expected them to send me a new keyboard and I would send back the faulty one in the original box which I kept.He couldn't assure me that the Apple store in Brussels would exchange the product or would take it in for repair. I really can't imagine how a smart keyboard can be repaired. It would 'only take a couple of days'. Being a very frequent international traveler I'm not used to spend half a day to get something 'perhaps repaired or perhaps replaced'. I want a solution for a faulty product immediately, certainly for products at premium Apple prices!
cie_B	jessica W	2017-07-16T22:00:00Z	1	Unacceptable customer service, their devices are not cheap and when one is broken don't expect them to admit to any manufacturing flaws. They want you to pay more money for extra coverage and repair fees easily adding 25% increase in cost. I prefer a company that takes care of their loyal customers.
cie_B	Gerard Nowland	2017-07-15T22:00:00Z	1	My apple mini pad, forced to be used by my company, is slow cumbersome to use. Try to up load new apps and edit text is impossible, apple need to include a user friendly key board as standard to allow for editing of just about anything. Oh and it does not remember anything I need it to remember, user names and passwords, especially since the key board is so bad. It keeps going into sleep mode, settings are not at practical to use for the lay person.Apple you need to keep everything simple, complex is not good.Disgruntled

cie_B	Gary	2017-07-13T22:00:00Z	2	A year ago I bought an IPad Pro with Smart Keyboard and stylus. It was a lot of money but I have loved it. Recently the iPad Pro quit connecting to the keyboard correctly. This made the ipad useless to me. Thankfully it works fine now after Apple serviced the keyboard. I sent mine to them 4 days ago in the box they sent me and received it back today. This would have been a great experience, except it wasn't. I first reported the problem to Apple well over a month ago after trying all the fixes I saw online. Boy was the internet full of stories just like mine.  I was told they couldn't help me until I gave them my serial number off the keyboard which was unreadable. I took a picture and sent it to Apple where they were able to read it. I was then told that if I give them my credit card info they would send me a box to return the keyboard, they would look at it and then decide whether to replace it for free or charge me for another one. I refused to give my credit card info. Please just send me a box and let me send you the keyboard. It took several chat's and phone calls this last month to finally get someone to send me a box. When they finally did I packed up the keyboard and sent it off. 4 days later it was back. When I opened the box I didn't know what to expect because there was no info from Apple. What did they do? Is it a new keyboard? No? Did you fix it? Looks like it. Now all is well. Except that given the option of an apple product or a non apple product I will NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE HOW YOU TREATED ME!!!!!!!!!!!! This includes the 2 iPhones, 3 iPads, an iPod, and hundreds of dollars per year on iTunes. I have seen the light and it shines on a rotten apple.     UPDATE- the keyboard worked right for 1 day. 😭

Everything seamed ok until I discover one hour after placing the order they took the whole amount £599 from my account. I caaled the immediately to stop the order and ask for refund but they said is too late, the only thing I can do is to refuse delivery. Ok, I refused delivery, I called them twice asking for refund but they said I have to wait until DPD is returning the phone, until they inspect it.....What for, I never been in possesion of this phone and they know that because I refused delivery. They shoudn't have sent it in the first place. This was an unauthorised transaction. They try to keep my money as long as possible.

cie_B	Caitlin	2017-07-07T22:00:00Z	1	"The key word here is ""unreasonable"" - Apple demands the absolute top dollar for their product. Good for them. But they should be able to back it up, and unfortunately, this is not the case. When I pay $1300 for a computer, as opposed to $700 for one of their top competitors (according to NASDAQ, the HP Envy), I expect the absolute best and longest lasting product on the market. Speaking as someone who has owned a variety of  laptops by a multiplicity of companies, Apple is not worth the money, and I'm no longer convinced that it is the best option for the money. My advice is to go with something else. Anytime you want to add any type of content onto an Apple product, it's practically an act of Congress. I appreciate security measures, but when it becomes excessively inconvenient, any security measure becomes absolutely ridiculous and superfluous. I'm totally disillusioned with this line of products, and I urge anyone and everyone to rethink their decision to buy these products."

cie_B	Kieran	2017-07-03T22:00:00Z	1	I broke my apple device and straight away I put a claim in to a 3rd party claim company, they asked me to clear my iPhone but I didn't know my iCloud password, when I tried to change this it wouldn't let me, I rang an adviser (not Shawnie originally- she has been very helpful) and they said I would receive an email to confirm to change my password, 2 weeks later I still hadn't received my email so I rang back. They said they would make sure I got the email (I then recieved this 4 days later, so a total of 2 and a half weeks) When I then received the email, I followed the instructions on screen and it then said I would have to wait another few days for a text to my phone with instructions on how to reset. I am now nearly a month down the line and still cannot send my phone off to get repaired. Overall I am disgusted in the way I have been treated, phone call after phone call and being told I will receive phone calls back and getting nothing! I will defiantly not be recommending Apple to anybody!
cie_B	Jonathan	2017-06-30T22:00:00Z	1	"Apple is the most rip-off company ever, they purposely make their products short lived so you buy more. Extremely overpriced products & even bad for mobile development, there is a 100$ yearly subscription plus a % of your earnings, the worst part is you need to buy their crappy computers to build the apps. The only good product they have is the iPod Touch but even those have a 1-2 year life, never buying products from them especially since they blocked ""Jail-Breaking"" which was the only reason that made it fun, now their products are just bricks with little to no customization. Unless you like overpriced crap with no ui customization, stay away!"

cie_B	Carole	2017-06-29T22:00:00Z	1	I just received a new iPad Pro, unfortunately it was a faulty product. As it was a gift bought on the online store, I had to call AppleCare to get a replacement. My experience with AppleCare has been horrendous, I spent more than 3 hours with them on the phone for achieving nothing. They were supposed to send me a return form, they never sent it. They considered my case closed. On the site my iPad was considered as sent back. When I reached on the online chat, they could not help me because my case was considered over. So I called again AppleCare, filled again the whole form over the phone. And once again never sent me the form! I went into the store to ask for help, after all I just wanted to return my iPad... so why was it so complicated? The staff was dismissive and told me that I had to call AppleCare and they could not help me.The thing is they kept telling me to call them, that this was the best thing to do. But I did not want to anymore, I was going nowhere with them. And there was no other way to reopen my case as the retail store did not want to help me. Having no choice - according to the Apple Store staff - I called them once again, filled again all the information because even though it was the third time they still did not record any information. A senior manager talked to me and told me my email was wrong and they never realised that over the 10 times I told them and made them repeat it to be sure they wrote it correctly? At this point I had no more trust in them. I finished the call, and I received a invoice for a new iPad arriving on the same day... I don't want to pay for a second iPad! And I still did not get the return form. AppleCare service is bad. Just bad. In the end I did not manage to send back my iPad or get a new one. I just got rid of my iPad. This experience just disguted me of Apple. I have no more trust in their customer service. They blocked the return process, closed my case, and were not helpful. In total, I spent about 6/7 hours with Apple customer service off and online... and got nothing from this exept a massive headache and two bad days. My advice: do everything in your power to never deal with AppleCare. Their team is badly trained, and untrustworthy. I expected so much better from Apple...

A few months later when I wanted to use the credit offered to myself, I am unable to use the credit put on my Account to purchase from the Apple store. When I have made contact with the customer relations department based in Singapore after hours of wasted time and pretencious behaviour from subordinates from that department, they advise me that the amount that is credited to my name is less than what was previously offered to myself of which I have proof of in writing to prove what  Apple have offered. The Department of customer relations within Apple are extremely badly managed and are stating lies to customers regarding credits put on customers account that the customer can NEVER use!The Apple Customer Relations Department will need to be taken through a legal process and sued to the highest degree of the law, this will then make them act more honestly and honorably!"

It was still under warranty.Now they are telling me there is liquid damage and it will be $755.I asked what liquid do they see...could it be a result of humidity?Their customer service is abominable.He does not have the money for a repair. I even asked if they could lower the repair cost. They declined. i am so disheartened and disappointed in my experience.We have Apple phones a tablet and desk top. Now we are finished with Apple. We will no longer purchase anything from them again.Microsoft has excellent customer service. They serviced my younger son's computer when it was out of the warranty period for free!They are pleasant and work with you.My son's entire High School chose Microsoft as the school product over Apple. Now I know why.
cie_B	MIKE TRAINER	2017-06-26T22:00:00Z	1	The Iphone is a an Over priced gimmick for something that you will easily spend twice the money for. The screen brakes very easily and is not under warranty. And once the screen cracks as it will the warranty is void. I bought my Iphone in to be fixed several times because the battery was defective. They refuse to fix or replace it. Leaving out the store my phone dropped and the screen cracked bad. I brought the phone in to have the battery looked at again and they said i would have to pay because of the cracked screen voids the warranty. The product is over priced and The Samsung Galaxy has a much better glass. Trust me I'm switching. And Samsung has a much better warranty policies.
cie_B	A Racktoo	2017-06-26T22:00:00Z	1	Apple Watch series 2 - worked for a while and I loved it!  Wouldn't charge so sent it back for repair/diagnostics.  Apple sent it back because it had a tiny crack in the screen/face.  They wanted £250 even though it was under warranty, due to the fact that to get to the inner workings i.e. To change the battery or diagnosis of the problem, removal of the screen is required!  I was happy living with the tiny crack but they tried to say it was a health and safety issue and that they could not fix it unless I paid the £250.......  that my friends is just WOW!!!!  Passed from pillar to post from Engineers to customer services and back again.  I sent it in under warranty for a charging issue which was covered under warranty.  In my eyes it's a very bad design fault as the only access to the inside of the Watch is via the front.  So in my eyes it's still their fault.   I've used apple for years and always have wanted to get their products.   Not anymore!!!!   Well done apple you failed!  I will not be purchasing another Apple product IOS is no better than any other platform.  After also discovering that Apple do not have a Review section on their website for their products proves to me that they are up themselves.  Do not buy an Apple Watch, if you do be prepared for high repair bills, very poor customer services and even their customer relations department failed to contact me as they promised.  Proving they do not care about their customers.  For the record I bought my product directly from them.  Hence why I am reviewing here

cie_B	Peter Gusta	2017-06-23T22:00:00Z	2	"The number of stars would have been one, but in all honesty there were no rude or offensive Apple or Citizen One Financial employee's.  The only thing offensive is the company's attitude towards it's customer base. Please allow me to explain.  We own many Apple iPhones and other products.  I visited the Evergreen Walk store in South Windsor Ct  on June 23rd to amongst other things, purchase an iPhone.  As we completed the very long and horribly tedious process of purchasing the phone using the 0% monthly payment plan, My 770 credit score was denied.  Yes that is right DENIED.  The ""process""  includes recording your drivers license, your credit card for automatic charges to your account, and collection of your SS # and birthdate.  I work very hard to maintain excellent credit but 3 years ago I was sued for $274. for a medical bill I disputed. I lost (I could not make it to court that day) and paid the $274 to the undeserved medical company for a duplicate payment for a medical test.  ALL that information becomes a part of your credit history.  And yes my credit score is still 770, since it had occurred far enough in the past.  I even very recently refinanced my mortgage and took out a home equity Loan on my house without any problems.  Citizen One financial however does not review your credit, if you have an unsatisfactory score or in my case a ""judgement"" you are denied, period.  Neither company apparently has anyone smart enough to read a credit report.  Citizen One claims that the standards are put in place by Apple, not sure I believe them though.  I spoke to both companies customer service they each blamed the other, big surprise.  I blame Apple for allowing a company mistreat it's customers in such a demeaning way.  When the the report came back I sensed the Apple employee's wanted to believe me, but still looked at me like I was a common criminal. Apple wants everyone to believe they are a socially conscious company, but in talking with their customer service for over an hour, I found them to be irresponsive, although they did say they would record my complaint.  They  refused to escalate my situation, stating that there was nobody to escalate to.  Not sure what we are going to do, but feel very betrayed by Apple."

I have tried a hand full of times to reset it to avoid getting the notifications that my account can not update. The card I had attatched to the account had expired. In the attempts to reset it has not worked. Today I finally find the time to call in and their solution to the problem is for me to just turn my devices off for days and maybe it would then reset. They refused to assist me with getting things straight and insisted that a 2 step prevents them from assisting. Mind you the 2 step was applied to the account after I have tried to access the account and had been denied. I am currently a full time nursing student and to make a suggestion to not use my devices is appalling that they don't care if I am unsuccessful in getting my degree by not using my iPad. In addition to suggest to someone to not use their phone, it is 2017, this is the only phone I have!!! I go walking and would not feel comfortable walking without a means to call for help if needed. They didn't care!!! Because of the horrible service today I would never recommend this company to anyone!!! If you have it sell!!! If you are thinking about buying it, think again... no point of having a product if their recommendation is for you not to use it!!! More then disappointed!!!

My iPhone 5 and 6 with the maximum memory now freezes after purchasing the 6 on 18 months ago. My Mac book pro is exactly the same. The updates seem to make it worse!!!

In fact started charging before my 6 months had expired for which I had to make two payments for.As for contacting them for my two months refund forget it its a nightmare. They dont want to know. Your out more on phone costs.They make it impossible to cancel membership I had to contact my bank to block my next payment. I cant believe a company so vast treat customers so poorly.Would not touch with a barge pole.They tell you they will phone you back and dont.Even stated they tried phoning me back when they clearly didnt as  waited in all day for that call. Shocking service.A word to the wise from one who knows.Long live spotify. A company that values its customers.spotify for me from now on

This was something that I didn't expect!I ask them to please stop all my automatic renewal from this moment on! I also ask them to removed my credit card information from my iTunes account!!In rewards, Ms. Nadine offer me 5 songs ... for almost $100.00 dollar withdraw!I told her: no, thank you! I only think that a full refund should be appropriate I also inform Ms. Nadine that I was doing an on-line review, they did not care at all!"
cie_B	Stuart	2017-06-10T22:00:00Z	5	I have been with Apple and its products for almost a decade now. I was extremely disappointed with many non Apple products' reliability. Yeah, other brands had more customization/features, but longevity of those products never impressed me. I've had many Apple products last since the first one I've purchased. Not only are the products easy to use, long lasting, attractive, but the customer service backing these is legendary. EVERY issue I have EVER had Apple has been polite, responsive, and quick to find a FAIR resolution. Overall, I am very satisfied with this company and continue to recommend them to family/friends.

More employees standing around then customers shopping. Was I disappointed with the attitude and general people skills of the employees that were supposedly going to help. . Although standing around with nothing to do they couldn't be bother to extend themselves and answer question with more then one word answers. ""Yes"", ""No"" ""not sure"". ""Haven't seen it yet"" etc.When trying to engage them in more in depth answers, they couldn't be bother.. All in all it is a good thing that Apple has a decent product because the sales people like the ones in the Westfield mall most certainly would turn anyone into an android user for sure!"
cie_B	Samantha Winters	2017-06-06T22:00:00Z	3	I had called them to fix my problem with my phone and they said they would call me back to continue helping. Called back and kept me on hold for 20 minutes and HUNG UP. Not happy.

It's great because you know you are speaking to a human and not just a robot and after speaking with her i just had to put i a great review.if you read this Mary, have a great life
cie_B	Jamie Batchelor	2017-06-02T22:00:00Z	4	The experience I have had with Apple is alright, you do get some issue with some customer staff on live chat not being that much of help, but their products are quality, I have basicly had a android aswell as iphone, and for the sake of security, Apple is the best, I own a macbook pro, I havent had much of a issue. i am not sure why people say it's bad, when clearly they are maybe ones to have misunderstood? Because I have not had much issue with the company in terms of product use or customer support.
cie_B	C Burden	2017-06-01T22:00:00Z	5	Although I love apple products,I was recently disappointed at the customer service I received in store at Westfield shopping mall London. I sat on a stool as I cannot stand for long due to surgery on my knees,only to be told you cannot use it as other people need it for appointments and promptly took it away put it back with the other 5 stools that were empty Even after explaining my disability .They lost out on a large sale from my friend due to this ,which I know is nothing to apple . This is not the first time I have experienced  this kind of attitude to  disability instore,disabilitys are not always visible. I think Apple need to rethink their policies.

cie_B	Arshad Khan	2017-05-24T22:00:00Z	1	Apple service. I purchase an I 7 phone and I have not been able to use it effectively problem is I call my clients and they cannot hear me. I went to the Apple shop in Milton Keynes. Where I have been passed around 5 members of staff. But got absolutely no further. This process took all of 2.5 hours. Despite speaking to staff about this nothing was done to assist me. I was told when I arrived that someone would see me within 30 minutes. In the end in order to keep my sanity I walked out of the shop. I am no further forward then when I started. I am now considering going to another IT provider. I have spent nearly £6000 pounds with this shop in the last 6 months. The staff are very well trained to fob you off. I would not recommend Apple if my life depended on it. These guys are extremely unhelpful. You are made to feel as though you are an inconvenience to them. If you are thinking of using them I sincerely ask you to reconsider.
cie_B	JON WEINSTEIN	2017-05-23T22:00:00Z	1	APPLE does not deserve 1/10000000th of the Dollars or accolades that it gets. Its configurations are so closed and insurmountably adjustable that one would think that adept, able tech support would be able to resolve the issues. THEY CANNOT. I realize that your average Apple phone tech support worker had severe, longstanding problems in school. I realize that their overall IQ is very low, and their ability to read, master, and problem-solve information and data are very, very poor. Yet, these highest of high priced devices come with your typical 2017 American educational outputs: Low end, stupid and poorly educated. And we wonder why offshoring occurs in this and other industries. If the problem is not a SIMPLE square peg in square hole SIMPLICITY-BASED  issue, they cannot cope. I have made 8 calls in one day on a problem. I am disgusted with the low level of technical and problem-solving abilities here.
cie_B	Susan Christian Edwards	2017-05-23T22:00:00Z	1	Awful customer service. I recently went in to have a phone fixed that stopped working. They deemed it unable to be fixed but I could buy another one at a discounted rate. Oh nice, right? WRONG!! It was a refurbished model. This was NOT explained to us. We were not told that we would not be able to buy insurance at the phone carrier OR Apple Care. Upon returning to the store wanting a refund they would not refund the the phone or service the now brand new phone that would not work in less than 3 weeks. UN believable that a company this large gets away with such poor customer service. I can not believe the run around I got trying to get customer service. Well I will definitely be voting with my pocket book. I will NEVER buy another apple product again. NEVER!

cie_B	D. Ripley	2017-05-22T22:00:00Z	1	I purchased an iPhone 4 days ago and have been unable to download any apps. I went into an Apple store and none of the workers could help me; they said I had to call Apple support. So the first woman I spoke to said I had to go into the Apple website and reset my Apple ID, which I did. My phone still did not work. Then I spoke to a second woman with Apple Support and she couldn't figure it out and went to ask her supervisor; she left me on Hold for over 20 minutes!! I finally hung up. Then I asked for the manager of the Apple store and he brought 2 technical people with him. They couldn't figure it out either. Finally, one of the techs figured it out after I had been in the store for over 2 hours.Horrible, horrible customer service! Why in the world would you leave someone on Hold for over 20 minutes?? And no one in the Apple stores can help you -- you have to do everything by telephone with the horrible Apple Support.I will NEVER NEVER buy another Apple product!
cie_B	pattylavigne	2017-05-21T22:00:00Z	5	Absolutely great! Well trained staffs! I was looking for a customised MacBook Pro which normally takes 14 days for build time and shipping. As I was urgently needed one (like get it in 2 days), the staff check refurbished stock and found one which exactly the same specs I want(custom built). Magically, they managed to deliver it to my home right the next morning! The staff even sent me a greeting email to make sure I received in the morning. Apple customer service is incredibly helpful and excellent ！
cie_B	James Delaney	2017-05-20T22:00:00Z	1	Charges for free apps and a delayed payment for paid items so much that you get the item without the payment going through.now it won't even let me  use a different card.never had this much trouble with androids
cie_B	Phoebe Shi Yi	2017-05-17T22:00:00Z	1	iTunes charges for apps that are free. The worst part is that you cannot actually download the app unless you put your card details down and NO WHERE during the download or even before is ANY price specified . This is illegal, you cannot charge a customer for a price you did not specify at or before the point of download. This is like a massive scam.
cie_B	Gareth Prosser	2017-05-17T22:00:00Z	1	Purchased an Apple Watch 2 directly from Apple within two days it had become unresponsive and froze. Contacted Apple directly via Service Support line, they were unhelpful. The process of returning the item is elongated and protracted, having to wait in for a courier who gives you a time slot which is just unhelpful. My money cannot be refunded for seven days until the Watch has been returned and received by the company.I expect more from a so called cutting edge company. Totally disheartened with Apple products, its service and support! After all the product is faulty yet I am made to suffer the consequences before my money is refunded!!
cie_B	Philip Chapman	2017-05-17T22:00:00Z	1	Purchased a Macbook pro  in 2014. The machine has been in for repair 6 times, with 5 of these being major parts being replaced. I am being refused a replacement, even though staff at Apple have stated that the machine will not last long, and that it has now met Apple's criteria for replacement.The company is happy to make me spend out on travel and waste my time getting the computer repaired consistently (so far, it has been around 5 months that the computer has been in repair for).No one will give us contact details for anyone higher in the company. The only way to go now will be either to get a repair (which staff hae said will not last long, will cost me in time and money when it breaks down again soon), or to take legal action against the company.I have had awful customer service, getting different answers from different people within the company. Don't buy Apple products, they aren't reliable, and the company takes no responsibility when the machines break down through their own faulty machinery.
cie_B	Graham Chapman	2017-05-17T22:00:00Z	1	The macbook has broken down several times. Apple have had it in for repair for months. The Apple engineers say there is a major problem with it and they have no faith that any repairs they do will last. Apple are refusing to do anything to give a permanent solution.No-one will give us any contact details to anyone who will look into it. The worst company I've ever experienced. Not only do their products not work but they are incapable of fixing them and will not take complaints or escalate the issue etc.This has cost us a fortune in returning it for repair as well as not being able to carry out work etc.

cie_B	Respond Asap	2017-05-13T22:00:00Z	2	I would like to share my negative customer service experience about Apple retail store which is located in Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Canada.Here is my story, which happened on May 13, 2017, from 1:40 pm to 2:20 pm. Repair No: R234957421. A few days ago, when I dropped my new iPhone 6S the first time ever, its screen has shattered.After that, I place the iPhone inside the protective case, and a week later I took it to Apple Yorkdale for screen replacement.Inside the Apple Yorkdale store I stumbled across many poorly designed business practices and procedures which make Apple customers look stupid and guilty when actually they are not.LIST OF EVENTS:1.The black guy who accepted my phone for repair, take a close look at my iPhone, but did not draw my attention to any scratches, and even did not mention about them at all! He just asked to read a half page of text and put signature on a touchscreen. Me, as many of you, made a mistake by not reading the text carefully, thinking that it was a standard legal bla-bla-bla and I just signed it.2. When I received my phone from repair, I noticed the scratch in the LOWER RIGHT corner and reported it to the dark beard guy who was releasing my iPhone after screen replacement. I expected that Apple will replace the scratched part, and that’s it. The guy printed out the Genius Bar Work Authorization form, which to my great surprise in the “Problem Description/Diagnosis” section stated (quote): “Issue: Custormer reportsPhone fell and glass crackedSteps to Reproduce: Visual verificationMRI. – passCosmetic condition: Display cracked –impact point TOP LEFTLight surface scratchesEmployee 1130550164”I did not remember any scratches in the LOWER RIGHT corner, and I firmly believed at that time that there was none when I passed my phone for repair. I asked the dark beard guy to contact the black guy who took my phone and confirm with him that there was no mentioning of any scratches before repair. He answered that that black guy had already left and cannot be reached. I am not that stupid, and I am sure that this standard “Light surface scratches” phrase is either automatically inserted by the Apple software, or routinely inserted by Apple employees who take iPhones in for repair, as insurance from customer complaints about pre-existing scratches. I understand their point, but it makes all customers automatically guilty when accidental scratch is made by Apple employees. Just do not tell me that it never happens Here are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was taking in for repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws for Apple as a whole):-Apple employee did not draw my attention to pre-existing scratches;-Apple employee did not take pictures of the iPhone’s back and sides which would allow Apple to prove its position if a complaint is made; 3. I asked to speak with somebody from the Apple store management team. Some grey beard guy came to me. His body language was explicitly saying: “Dude, stop wasting my time!” Again, he referred to the “Light surface scratches” and said that he cannot help me with my complaint.Finally, I was asked to sign a two page long legal disclaimer, which I have read carefully this time, and I made a handwritten note above my signature about the newly discovered scratch.Here are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was release after the repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws in Apple as a whole):-The employee who was taking phone in for repair cannot be reached;-The touchpad for customer’s signatures is oversensitive, and it took me SEVERAL attempts to right my comment above the signature because several times I accidentally pressed the “Clear” link on the screen;-The employees who participated in the conflict resolution discussion did not introduce themselves, and I am almost sure they are not added their notes and employee numbers to the Genius Bar Work Authorization form as a conflict resolution participants.I hope, that somebody from Apple will read this feedback, and pass the flaws to the upper management for review.Overall, this visit to Apple Store changed my impression about Apple to worse, and their employees do not look trustworthy any longer for me.I hope that my complaint will make potential customers think twice before purchasing from Apple!-----------MY ADVICE TO APPLE CUSTOMERS: Take in the Apple store another camera, and make pictures in presence of Apple employee before passing them your Apple product for repair!

cie_B	علي دلول	2017-05-01T22:00:00Z	1	My experience with IPhone in a few days (April 28th  to May 2nd) 2017 and the amount of difficulties and errors.1. Updation my IOS software was impossible for an error message.2. After plugging my phone to my pc, I could not open it anymore, requesting me to update my phone, noting that the update was not working. (This state remained for few hours)3. After talking to support, it opened, only to give me an activation lock screen, requesting me to put my first ever Apple ID password used.(Unfortunately based on password requirement (upper case lower case, number etc, I couldn't remember my password.)4. Chat support can't solve this issue (which makes in my personal opinion at least little sense). Anyways, so I had to wait for 2 days until apple support calls me. That was due May 2nd 2017 at 10.45am.They call as promised at 10:50am, I answered and after 30 sec the line cut off on his own. No other attempt was made. Its 12:01 pm as I write this review.. 5. From 10:50 am till 12:01pm I am trying to contact support, by chat and call. Error messages kept coming. When attempting a call, it gives me a error. When attempting chat, it keeps loading with nothing coming up.At the same time, another error kept on coming (403 forbidden) when I press contact support. 6. I go to my email, and see an email from support telling me they have been trying to call me, but receive voice mail. a. I never ever had voice mail on my phone, and its a service I don't even have on my phone.b. How come I was contacted the first time successfully with no voice mail. Yet my phone didn't ring since.7. In any case, lets forget phone attempts, I try contacting support on the emails they sent me, I keep getting automated messages that this email doesn't get checked. Even when the personal assistant Savannah and Chelsea both talk to me on chat, and one of them even sent me a personal message by email, the thing I couldn't do.Conclusion:It is quite obvious I am writing this while being emotionally stirred, and even a little angry, 3 days to solve a very simple thing and its the problem that came from something I can't control (the update) and the errors that came with it. Plus if I may add something, if we users change our passwords because we forgot them, how reasonable is it to be able to unlock my phone with a password I forgot, even though a new one is working!!! Please look at this apple. And even giving authority for people on chat to solve things is much more easy for users without going into the hassle of appointment for a call.In short, I am a dissatisfied with all this, and its only naturally I am, after I have stayed patient for 3 days. I am editing this now, its 14:16 pm, and I finally succeeded in applying for a call without an error, I received 6 phone calls, after applying for a call as much, yet after I press 1 to connect to an advisor as they say, the line cuts off. This is a lot.. what more to say..Editing again. Its 18:34 p, seems I have to throw my phone, because of security protocol. Cant even write anymore to explain.

cie_B	AM Roberts	2017-04-29T22:00:00Z	2	I visited the local Apple Store recently to decide on the purchase of an iMac. So the normal drill -- you walk in and someone takes your name and puts you in a queue. No indication on the amount of time you have to wait. So we stand around for about 10 minutes and decided to come back after grabbing a bite to eat. We returned and same process. So we waited about 15 minutes and a woman staffer comes up to address our questions -- then this clapping and cheering breaks out. The staffer asks us to wait until the commotion settles down before proceeding, but it went on and on and on... turns out another staffer was leaving after his final shift and this was the way employees are sent off. This was extremely annoying because he stopped to hug every employee with brief conversations. This continued --while we THE CUSTOMERS -- waited because our staffer had joined in the cheering and clapping for the duration of this activity. Ok -- I get the team connection, but Apple, there would be no team if not for the consumer. By the time this episode wrapped up I was ready to leave and make no purchase but we stuck it out to get our questions answered. And frankly the staffer was not very knowledgeable. So we left and I have chosen not to make a purchase. I am disappointed and angered with the employee first -- customer last mentality that I witnessed at this store. This should have been a private show for employees only -- not at the expense of store customers.

cie_B	Frederik Seersholm	2017-04-29T22:00:00Z	1	My iPhone 5SE screen cracked spontaneously last monday (24th of April, 2017). Nothing happened that could explain these cracks – I had my phone in my pocket while I was sitting down, when I took it out, the screen was broken. I’ve had an iPhone 4 for 4 years before I got the new iPhone5SE, and in that period, I’ve never had a cracked screen. The phone was protected by the Apple Leather Case and it has never been dropped, or damaged in any other way. As stated in the attached ‘Genius bar work Authorisation’ (Apple_Store_Work_Authorisation.pdf) there is ‘No other significant damage to report’ – not even a scratch.The cracks emanate from the middle of the screen (see attached picture), a very peculiar location of cracks to occur as a result of an impact. This must be an effect of a manufacturing issue with this particular screen. This is not an uncommon issue. Spontaneously cracked iphone screens is a well-known phenomenon in the newer generation of iPhones (just google spontaneously cracked iPhone screen).I clearly stated to the Apple employee that my screen spontaneously cracked without impact, but they still refused to replace my cracked screen. I don’t see what I could have done differently, as I have been extremely careful to protect my very expensive phone.

cie_B	Cheriza	2017-04-17T22:00:00Z	3	"Thoughtfully designed products but the manufacturer has a bit of a ""if we build it, they will come, complex.""  Lot's of solid offerings from competitors, many with better features, and yet Apple decides to charge an arm and a leg.An example is the 27"" Thunderbolt II Cinema display (now discontinued), that retailed for over $900 (the cost of a new computer) but used dated technology and had a rather poor resolution.  It was bulkier than a 27"" iMac with retina display."

Got iPhone 7 plus and no one helped me while I had problems setting up phone and transferring files from my previous Samsung. Went to Three shop opposite apple and they helped me  doing the whole process that lasted no longer than 10mintes. Rate ZERO to Apple and staff in WIMBLEDON.

Now, this whole episode began because I could not remember my password (which I have never used!), so, my assumption is that if my password would be reset, I would have use of my phone. How long does it take to reset a password?If anyone has experienced this ""goat-roping"" I would appreciate some feedback.TIA"

I have had one faulty cable replaced with no issues in store within the last 10 years. I brought back in a faulty cable to the store yesterday to be told straight away from the advisor that she would not replace it. I asked for the manager, the manager came and also said he would not replace it as he deemed the cable to be damaged. I admittedly said I should of taken the 2 mtr (£30 cable) back sooner when the outer sheath first showed signs of it splitting but due to work and not having time off I took it back earlier  bearing in mind the cable is only 4 months old. The manager stated as in their (VMI) they would deem the cable as damaged, don't ask me what VMI means as the manager never knew either. I asked to see the guidelines several times but was refused. A guy from the Geeky bar was requested to inspect the cable and it was obvious from his manner that he was going to say the same thing. Apparently if you look close enough with a NASA telescope you will be able to find the serial no on the cable in which they were unable to read in store. The guy also started nick picking on marks on the cable barely visible to the human eye, I'm still looking for them.  I was advised that the only solution would be for me to contact Apple support and send them photos, bearing in mind I had now been in the store for 2 hours and it had cost me £4.50 in parking let alone fuel and time to replace a faulty item under warranty. I then went home and called Apple Support to speak to an understanding Irish gentleman who understood my frustrations and was keen to get the issue resolved although he required the serial no of the cable. I had to try and locate the serial no and call him back but without the necessary telescope of microscope it was impossible. I called back to speak to another advisor who asked me to take photos of where we thought the serial number was so she could have a look. We took photos of the cable and sent them to her and there were no surprises when she could not read the serial no either. Having now spent 6 hours trying to return a £30 2 metre cable she agreed to send me out a replacement. Having now experienced this I'm sickened at the support from the local Aberdeen store and as I said to the manager he has now forced me down the route to purchase imitation cables from Amazon in which I can get a 2 metre cable for £6. If any genuine customer ever goes back with a faulty cable I really hope you do not have to go through the pain that I had to go through. I will now be purchasing imitation cables from now on as well as reviewing ways with my IT company to look at changing over our devices from Apple to another system.  I would not be writing this if I never felt so strongly about this.

cie_B	|Deborah B	2017-04-04T22:00:00Z	1	Had an Apple Iphone 6s with faulty battery and was one of the ones that could be changed for free.  Took it in and after an hour and a half were told they'd opened the phone up and found the water damage marker had gone off and they put it back together without a new battery as they couldn't guarantee the phone.  The phone was working perfectly when we took it in, we weren't aware of any water damage (apparently even being left in a bathroom can set this off!!) but now the phone won't even switch on.  Apple's attitude is that we should've taken out extra care policy and then it could've been repaired or replaced otherwise we will have to pay for the repair/replacement - fair enough but what they don't get is that the phone was working perfectly before it was taken in and didn't have a problem apart from the battery! I am now left with a phone that doesn't work and 8 months left on a contract.

It couldn't complete the update and I was locked out of my laptop, worried that I would lose everything on it if i did something wrong- I called up Apple they were so unhelpful and at first told me to click a few different things and they clearly didn't know what they were doing- then they told me that they can't help me because my laptop was purchased 5 years ago and is ""vintage"" and they can only help out with newer Macbooks. I was in such a panic because I am a college student and my whole life is on this laptop- assignments, papers, pictures, everything. I called my brother in law who works with computers and it took him around 15 minutes to explain to me over the phone how to fix the problem. Everything is back to normal now, thanks to him. Im honestly shocked at how unhelpful Apple's service is and it has changed my entire view on the company."

Once we started using it again we couldn't connect to certain sites.  We called Apple and the people on the phone were wonderful.  They helped as much as they could from a remote location.  Unfortunately, we needed to take it to the locale Apple Store in Greensboro, NC.  We got an appt the same day.  While there having an Apple tech look over our PC, we experienced a very friendly and knowledgeable technician.  He fixed our problem within the hour and we didn't get charged anything.

Astonished that a well established company such as Apple has caused so much upset in my household. The employees do not know their own complaints system and the complaints team are incredibly rude. Minimum of 8 hours spent on the phone, 3 letters sent to apple offices - after being told THE INCORRECT ADDRESS BY APPLE EMPLOYEES - and with nothing in return. Request made for phone call recordings and notes from employees so my complaint could be raised higher but this was rejected by complaints team. MAY AS WELL NOT BOTHER AS YOU'LL BE WASTING YOUR TIME.

cie_B	Keith Manaton	2017-03-02T23:00:00Z	2	Apple may be help with their own products BUT ... If a third party product & it goes wrong they immediately go into deflect & total non-responsibility mode. Under British Law they must replace a product with 30 days. Outside this retailers have discretion to repair or replace. Apple will try & make you feel like you're being 'unreasonable' by 'evoking' the Sales of Goods Act & only after an argument, offer to replace a product. So if you have an external device which has data you need to recover they won't help you by liaising with the original manufacturer. You're on your own. My advice is not to buy any third party products from Apple. You can usually get them cheaper elsewhere anyway.

I thought my son had accidently purchased some apps so I called customer service and not only was it super quick, but the guy was amazingly nice and so helpful. He got a tech on the other line and had them look everything up and come to find out it was my sons dad that purchased iCloud storage lol and I didn't know about it. So Shawn was super helpful about the whole thing and even sent me an email with info and links if I do need help again with that or anything else. Thanks Apple I'm happy to say that I actually am a fan now! The iPhone 5s my son has is very sturdy also and it works great for him so great service AND products.

The very first time I was hung up on the person had an attitude when picking up the phone, asking how he could assist me, after explaining the problem calmly there was complete silence for about 10 seconds and then they just hung up. The second time I was on hold for about 20 minutes before I was eventually hung up on. Apple's customer service team is by far the worst and rudest customer service I have ever encountered.
cie_B	Anna	2017-02-22T23:00:00Z	1	"Bought a 27"" iMac a year ago at £1995, yes! I was that stupid to pay such amount in hopes for a well functioning Product without headaches. Guess what! The mac started behaving weird after about three weeks. It started freezing and it only got worse and as I write this review, it's completely dead now. I have been in tears on phone explaining the problem to apple, I have spent time/days and weeks worth more than the price of the iMac - trying to troubleShoot the issue. After about 12 months in agony I told them this must end now so I need to annul the purchase and buy another computer as my family couldn't live like this anymore. It was at this point that they reffered me to a local repair shop. I carried the heavy machine to the store who retained it for about a week and yet the problem wasn't fixed properly. Apple has trained their workers to act like robots. There're  no human understanding or feelings of any kind at all. All you get is a very sweet ""hooker-like"" lovely voice who starts the conversation in a way as if they understand your problem but all you get is; ""I can see you've been having the problem for a long time now, I'll do my best to help you now. I'll be the one to deal with this from now onwards. I'll call you back..."". On the other hand I even got a response like: ""we've never got any complaints from anyone before. Even if you know of any complaint then it's a drop in the ocean compared to how much we sell without any complaints"". My screen completely failed and turned black three days ago. I called in crying for help. I received the usual robot-like response saying the problem is a bit too complicated so they would have to hear the opinion of the engineers who made the software and whole design of the iMac then they'd give me a call back latest the following day, which was yesterday but one, but no one has called me back yet and we're at the end of third day. There's no cooperation with Apple. Once they've got your money for their overly priced products, you're on your own. Apple really sucks when it comes to after-sales services including customer care. As said, the ""sweet"" telephone  voice only works when the issue is easily fixable. Otherwise those who give more than one star in review of apple would regret it badly. Now all I have to do is to file a complain to the consumer board authority and this may take all from six months to one year. So where does it leave me? I am forced to go and invest in a new computer while waiting for the case to be handled. Apple is not even moved by this message from me. Shocking indeed how a company of this size can treat people like crap while strapping us of millions! NEVER BUY APPLE products unless you're sure it'll work throughout the duration you expect to own it or unless you have too much money that you don't care about losing! Because you will never see that money again if the product fails. I mean NEVER!! You lose in all ways. In my case, I have already lost more than what I paid for the product , so even if I win the case with the consumer board, I'll never recover the time spent chasing for it, the headache along the way, the documents lost during troubleshooting and reinstalling the computer, the daily growing frustrations, etc. I have lost big time!"

But nothing is happening, after spending 620 pounds on this phone i dont expect this sort of service from apple, i am so disappointed. Literally disgusting customer service. Its not even my fault that there is a lock on it, its apples fault but they are not just sorting it out, seems like its never going to work and apple is unable to solve the issue! Disgusting!!!!

I have never had a rude or impersonal person yet. Let me give you my most current experience:At the end of a 6 week project in Final Cut. Computer crashes. I call Apple in a panic since this project will be viewed in 1 week and it has taken 6 weeks to get to this point. Not only do they remote into your computer....but they try everything. We were blessed to have Casandra - Senior Advisor, help us out. She had us copy files which would take 4 hours and told us she would call back to go to step 2 before she left for the evening. Not only did she call us back but she stayed over her time to make sure that she restored the entire project for us. That is over and above the word ""support"".

I took it into the Apple Store Covent Garden who were very nice, but told me that there is nothing they can do about it. They referred me to a Data Recovery company but say that there is nothing they can do to help. If you are considering one of these products, don't bother. Save your £250 and buy an online backup service. It will cost more in the long run, but at least you will have you're data at the end of 2.5 years which is far more valuable.

I called last week and they tested the battery on my iPad and said I needed a new battery. Made an appointment to drive an hour and a half to get the battery replaced only to find out they didn't replace a battery they gave you a whole new iPad which of course they did not have in stock because they did not communicate to the store the situation.  So today I get an email that the replacement part is in stock and to come back to the store.  Spent 45 min just trying to get another reservation and hopefully when I go next week on my hour and a half jaunt that they will get this taken care of. Not one time did anybody explain that your iPad needed to be fully backed up because you're just going to get a new one and it's up to you to get everything set up again.  Just basic details that they should communicate.

That means its working for someone other than myself. When the hard drive crashed, they offered to upgrade to the latest operating system. I was agreeable and had the drive replaced and upgraded. Even though bootcamp made a partition for a windows installation, the windows system will not go on line. It worked fine on my old MacBook pro.  I have downloaded three different sets of drivers and adapters, changed from 32 to 64 bit installations. But it will not go on line. Apple refuses to work with the windows system. I must turn to another source than apple for help. I'm considering just buying a windows laptop. two programs I use as a teacher require windows.
cie_B	Iain	2017-02-08T23:00:00Z	3	I changed from PC to apple over 7 years ago and my machine is as fast today as it was then.Love their products but they are losing a grip on profit over customer service.One of the biggest issues they have is tighter scrutiny over app developers; especially those who charge users for upgrades.They need to self regulate before governments across the world start looking into practices around in-app purchases. There are quite a few companies making huge amounts of money using clever marketing tactics and Apple is taking it's fair share of the profits.iOS users deserve to be better informed on value for money. Some of the games on Apple Store cost hundreds of pounds of investment to make real progress and gamers should be warned about this before committing any time or money.Apple could provide a breakdown of how much people spend on each app (on average) as a guide.There is nothing more frustrating for a gamer than supporting an app, only to find they need to spend more and more for max rewards.It is so easy to rack up £20, £50, £100+ on a game before you realise you have been had.Apple and app developers need to be more transparent and provide customers with better value for money.Please wake up Apple before it's too late!
cie_B	Sarah Whitehead	2017-02-07T23:00:00Z	1	So I've never really been into Apple; I think they're overpriced and I've always thought of them as quite a snobby company.  However, my boyfriend loves them and convinced me to try out their products.  So for Christmas, he bought me an iPhone 6 and I bought him an iPhone 6S, the new Apple TV, an Apple controller and the new iWatch, totalling to approximately £1750.  I am one of these people that hate paying for overpriced merchandise, but I thought, for the price, at least they should be decent and last a long time.  And I would've assumed, after spending that amount of money, that Apple would give a s@*t if there were any problems.  How wrong of me.  At Christmas, my boyfriend opened his watch and was over the moon, but it would barely fit on his wrist.  We joked about how they must of made them for super skinny wrists!  However, a month later, we found out that Apple make watches for women and men (although they deny this).  So I emailed them and said that I wasn't very happy because I had obviously bought the women's watch, despite saying to the sales guy that I was buying it for my boyfriend.  I told them that my boyfriend was thinking about selling the watch and buying the other one, which is really heart-breaking for me, because it was so much money.  £400 is a lot of money, obviously not to them, but to me, it's a ridiculous amount.  And there's only about £20 difference in the two watches, so obviously I would've liked to have gotten him the bigger one for the extra £20, but I wasn't given this option from their ill-informed staff.  So, I got an email from them about a week later saying that they don't do men and women's watches, just different sizes of the screen and if I wasn't happy, my boyfriend should sell the watch and put it towards a new one.  I was absolutely gobsmacked.  Firstly, do you not think I should have been told that there were different sizes?  I know nothing about Apple, and they should assume that for all their customers.  I went into their store to ask for their help, specifically.  Otherwise, I would've just ordered online (which I wish I would have because I probably would've been given more information).  Secondly, they obviously didn't listen to a word I said, because I told them I did not want him to sell the watch.  It actually makes me feel gutted and to tell a customer to sell their brand new item, instead of making THEIR mistake right, is disgraceful.  Actually disgraceful.  Who in the hell do they think they are?!  I would've actually been more agreeable if they had said that there was nothing they could do.  But to tell me to sell it.  I still can't get over it now.  What shoddy customer service.  Obviously once they sell you their overpriced products, they don't want to know any more.  I don't think I've ever felt let down more by a company and it just solidifies my views on these sorts of companies.  Never again will I shop at Apple.  Shocking customer service, if you can call it that.

Thursday at 1200 the watch delivered to my house by FedEx in Florida after being repaired in pa. Less than 48 hours are u kidding me !!!! I've been around along time I've never seen anything like it . Hmmmm wonder what brand I'm always going to buy. I could say more but have to tell my friends and neighbors.

I got my headphones BUT when I sent them I guess he forgot to tell me not to put the cable in (which I put it in incase it was the cord that caused the sound not to work) so when the repaired headset I was missing the audio cable so now I had to do the process over again. This time I was connected to a man that was very irritated and  just made it a lot harder to get my aux cable back very rude not actually trying to help me kind of ""just trying to do his job and go home."""

Next day I wanted to see it again and to my surprise it wasn't there anymore and my order was gone. I forgot to write down the order #.I found the film at Blu Ray.com where it costed the above mentioned price and I  see they have raised it to $ 17.99 today with no improvement. There site on Google is not the same as when ITunes is opened, all mixed up. I learned that I have to write at Google, the name of the film + itunes, click at the film + click what resolution you want then click at the shop and you are there.    So all in all it wasn't a good experience at all and it is the last time I will use it and just wave goodbye to my money.Is that the standard  APPLE has at their other products that will not make me a fan.

Staff are rude and unhelpful.  About on par with Telstra customer service - meaning it's crap and does not exist.  Utterly, utterly painful experience.  Microsoft, I'm heading backwards your way - I give up on apple!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡

Their customer service has always been exceptional. Their products last a long time with no issues, we wouldn't buy any other product.
cie_B	The Seventh Move	2017-01-20T23:00:00Z	2	Apple had dominated the Business-Personal tech consumer market since the 1980s with the launch of Apple1. Since then it had gained popularity - but with the arrival of Windows by Microsoft and IBMs along with Compaq, HP, Dell, and other players in the market it had some where lost it's shine. But with the launch of iPhone it came in the market like a shining Sun of early morning that glows everything around it. But I think Apple Inc. wasn't able to continue with the innovation thirst of the techies all over the world and has lost it's ground in front of Chinese makers and also from some competitors like Google Inc.

cie_B	VAM	2017-01-17T23:00:00Z	1	I have one of the iphones which had a faulty battery - Apple manufacturing issues - which Apple said they would replace for free. I spent close to 6 hrs on the phone to trying to get an appointment as not having my phone for 10 days, taking a day's leave to get an appointment or waiting for five hours on the off chance of getting an appoint at one of their stores.  I eventually had an appointment with one of Apple's approved suppliers for a battery replacement on the day, when they emailed me just before and said they phone would be taken away for 5 days at least, they then went on to inform me there were not Apple approved (despite me booking on the Apply website).  I had no alternative but cancel the appointment.  I then tried to get another appointment to no avail, eventually calling Apple to try and get one or to see if they had a priority booking system for their faulty batteries.  They don't and they don't care as they have already sold the phone.  Before I spent 5 hours on a walk in appointment, I called AppleCare to find out if the Apple store had replacement batteries. After already being on the phone for almost and hour, I was put on hold for 1 1/2 hrs by a senior customer service agent, I then had to phone again and was on the phone for another 1 hr.  When I tried to complain, I was told: - AppleCare does not have a complaints process- Apple Store does not have a complaints process for Apple Customer Service- Apple website does not have a complaints process.- Due to Apple's inability to manage or deal with complaints I used Resolver which Apple said they refuse to respond to.So basically there is no way to complain... Apple won't be on my list for a replacement phone.

cie_B	Qaiser Ayub	2017-01-14T23:00:00Z	1	Apple service in their store is very terrible.I don't want to get it wrong but it was good at the beginning but now in 2017 it is very terrible.First of all when you book an appointment it will take at least ten minutes on the Internet and at least twenty minutes if you go to the store one.When I booked my appointment and I went to the store to check out my devices my time was 17:30 and I had to wait an extra half an hour for my turn.The charges are very high as well, so I had an IMac and it had a technical fault something to do with the mouthboard or logic board.So you tell me there is a technical and I don't have a warrant because it ran out so I had to pay at least £565 just for that.If there was an accidental fault then I would've paid that much but come on its your product fault so you should charge me less.As I said before Apple's services have gone very down hill.

Just in 2017 I have had to contact Apple twice unfortunately I have broken my phone and I'm being charged twice for Apple Music. First my Apple Music after 2hrs on hold my phone died and I lost connection no one called me back and I'm still paying for 2 lots of Apple Music terrible terrible service. Second my phone, it is out of warrently by 3 weeks so I contact Apple to get a repair witch is fine. £126 and a new phone , ok no problem , send my phone of 2 weeks ago and Apple have said they never received it and I have to loacate it in order for them to get me a new one sent out. The tracking number says it was delivered.... again  terrible service

Inherited my nieces iPad 1 a couple of years ago. Worked fine for emails, internet, reading PDF files etc., but now there is no PDF reader available for IOS 5.1.1 and no secure browser available in App store.
cie_B	diane Tran	2017-01-12T23:00:00Z	1	First, let me give the Apple employees I spoke with 5 stars for their courtesy.Second, 0 star for apple product and how their system works. My brand new ip7 had a problem, front mic and receiver failed, do not work. Great for a brand new phone, isn't it? The tech was trying for at least 1 hour to repair it but couldn't, he also tried to give me a new iphone but the system did not allow him to enter the new serial number. The only solution was to send  it to the company's repair department, I don't know where. So I left the phone at the local store for it to be sent out and was told that I would get it back within 4 days. 5 days passed and I had to call APPLE (on hold for more than 30 min) to have it sent back to me. However, as of at this very moment, i.e. 24 hours later, I have not received my phone yet (that was supposed to be sent overnight), I called UPS and found out that APPLE put in a wrong address. I am writing this review when on hold with APPLE, 36 min have passed and still on hold for the customer service to investigate.Awful services from such a big company

She has the friendliest personality and she would not give up until the problem was solved. Apple is lucky to have her. I was beyond frustrated and she stayed with me until the problem was solved. I was ready to scream when she came on the line, but she completely diffused my anger with her sincerely nice introduction. She made me feel like she truly wanted to help me, and she did!

cie_B	Randolph Chater	2017-01-11T23:00:00Z	1	I took my iPhone into an apple store to get the screen replaced. They told me the phone burned up, and they gave me another. It was faulty, I have taken it in to them twice. The second time they told me they could not fix it and I would have to buy another. So I took in a working phone with a cracked screen and they gave me one that didn't work. I own an apple TV, and iPad and a mac. I will not be buying another apple product.I paid to have a broken screen replaced on a working phone. My payment to them results in my having a non-working phone, and they refuse to do anything about it. This was in the store at San Tan Village in Arizona.
cie_B	Gail Cardozo	2017-01-10T23:00:00Z	1	"About November 5th 2016  I finally decided to stop using my iPhone 5s that I have had for 3 years and get the new Iphone 7. After two months of using it, I noticed the home button would just get stuck, wouldn't work for a whole day and then automatically go back to working the next day. This happened three times in a row! When my phone just randomly went off on New Years day and heated to a point where i couldn't even touch it, I decided I really needed togo into the apple store and get it checked out by a professional. Note that  I'm an extremely careful person, considering I have had an iPhone 5s for three years with no damage. So when I took my brand new phone to the apple store in the UES, one of the guys at the genius bar tried to diagnose it and he failed, they could not get it to even power on. He confirmed with me that there was no water damage, scratches or any kind of cosmetic damage on the phone and mentioned that it is mostly a defect in the interior of the phone. He assured me that I would not have to pay for it since it was no fault of mine and said they would have to send it to the service center to investigate the problem. When I received an email a week after that my phone was ready for pick up I was absolutely excited. I went to the store only to find out that they were charging me a $347 for a replacement for the phone. I was dumbfounded as I did not expect to be charged for a replacement as it was not my fault at all.  So i asked to have my phone back thinking maybe i could have it repaired elsewhere. But they refused to do that and said they cannot give me my phone back. The exact words said to me were, 'You either pay and walk out with the new phone, or leave without a phone."" I was furious, believe me I still am. I asked for some kind of proof, or a report stating there was a physical damage with the phone, but he had none. Now I have never had a bad experience with Apple, but for the first time I feel cheated and lied to. I beleive it is not okay to do this to customers. It's so sketchy and I find it hard to understand how there would be damage considering I did not drop the phone/wet it and there was not a single scratch on it. I did leave paying the $347 they asked me to, but I left unhappy and unsatisfied. I left feeling cheated. All I'm asking for is justice and I don't beleive the way Apple handled this was fair or right."
cie_B	Anthony Trzeciak	2017-01-07T23:00:00Z	1	"I recently purchased an Apple iphone 7Plus from Apple's online store.  According to the order page, if I placed the order within the allotted time, I would receive the phone the following day at no charge.  I placed the order (over $900) immediately, paid in full and received a purchase confirmation, also stating that the phone would arrive the next day, Saturday, December 31st.  An hour later, I received a FEDEX shipping confirmation email stating that the phone would be delivered the following Tuesday, due to the New Year's Holiday.  I contacted Apple's customer service by chat (I do have a transcript) and was essentially to told to be grateful for receiving free shipping, that the ""next day commitment"" on their website wasn't a guarantee and to essentially pound sand.  Really unhappy, I also spoke to a customer service supervisor, Jason R., who stated that there was not much of a chance that he could get the phone to me by Saturday, but he would be in touch with me after the holidays...it's been a week since I made my $900+ purchase and not a single word from anyone.As a consumer, I rarely experience problems with merchants when a transaction gets fouled up...generally the merchants are sympathetic and offer to make things right.  Consequently, I am completely dismayed with Apple's complete disregard for it's advertised commitments and its customer.  They do not deserve my hard-earned $'s, nor yours.  Still fuming!"
cie_B	Alan W.	2017-01-05T23:00:00Z	1	"If fraud, lies and incompetence is your idea of customer service, Apple is your company.  Their completely inept customer relations scam of a department has managed to botch a simple refund of a recalled item over a period of 5 months that should have taken less than one week to complete.  My only remaining option is to sue them in small claims court for not refunding my money or product.  Can't wait to hear their ""we can't do that""  excuses this time. What a total waste of time and energy.  Never buy an Apple product again."
cie_B	Paula Mertes	2017-01-05T23:00:00Z	1	I went to 3 stores to get my screen fixed and to get people out of my account that have hacked into it. In the london store they first told me they cant fix it because they dont have prove that it is my phone. they also told me a person had hacked into my account, the apple support over the phone told me another different person had hacked into my account. I had the delivery receipt from my dad of the phone that i got for christmas but the store manager said we cant use it because it was purchase a week before it was activated (obvisously for christmas!!!!) .. so they made me wait 3 hours. The stores around me in germany have no  appointments anywhere close to when i want to get my phone fixed and in one store they told me the fixing time takes 3 hours, although in london they told me it takes 1. Very rude and not reliable. Apple support on the phone makes you wait for ages and no one knows how to help you. If apples system is so bad to get hacked into they should at least provide the right service to kick those people out. After all this i still dont have my iphone 6 fixed and just getting the iphone 7 now, because there is just no way. I guess just be careful with your phone so you never have to get in contact with apple support. Real idiots
cie_B	Laiaj	2017-01-04T23:00:00Z	1	I recently bought an iPhone from Apple. From the start, it was a faulty phone as the microphone failed to work from the day I purchased it. I spoke to Apple many times however they didn't provide me with any help at all. Recently, the microphone completely stopped working, so I phoned Apple and they said the nearest branch to me has no appointment available, however when I mentioned how bad the service was from Apple, then they asked me to take it to the nearest branch to see if they can fix the problem. The branch technical support defined the phone as faulty, so they replaced it with one that they classed as 'new'. However, it looks to me as though it was somebody else's phone due to the fact that somebody else's email keeps appearing on the phone and requires a password, which is not my email. I am not happy with the way Apple Service spoke to me, therefore I am extremely disappointed as I have been an Apple fan for many years. It is unfortunate that I cannot give 0 stars as if the option was there, I would not rate the Service with any stars at all. Very disappointed.

cie_B	Cassy	2017-01-03T23:00:00Z	2	"I have loved my Apple products in the past, but this experience is about enough to turn me away from them for good. I purchased a new iPhone 6 less than two months ago. The purchase experience was great and I have loved the phone until this weekend. I didn't really intend to do the newest update, but one of the frequent requests to update caught me and I allowed it to happen. Immediately I had issues. My phone died and would not restart. Yes, I tried pushing the home button and the on/off button for 10 seconds...I got the apple logo, then it died again. I tried holding them for 45 seconds while plugged into iTunes and got the update/restore screen. Unfortunately, the phone would not update or restore properly. I tried the online Apple support and got no help other than mentioning the things I had already tried. His solution was to try a different computer. Eventually the phone actually did go through a total restore and then update from my last back up using the computer I had been on all along. I was frustrated to have spent 6 hours messing with it, but relieved to have my phone back. I went to bed more happy than not. In the morning, I overslept because the phone had died again while plugged in. We were back to square one...black screen, apple logo fading away...ready to cry or scream or both, I made a Genius Bar appointment at the location 45 minutes from home. I know I am lucky to have one that close, but it is still quite a drive when coupled with the two and a half hours spent in the store. The technician was ok. She did what she could but couldn't fix the phone. She eventually said I would get a new phone, but then said oh no, wait you only get a loaner. We have to send this one in to be repaired. That means when it comes in or when they decide they can't fix it I will have to take off work and go back in to the store. The loaner they provided to replace my phone with 128 GB of memory as 12 GB. It won't download all the apps I use for work. I have deleted almost all my photos and still no luck. I am so frustrated. I paid for a very nice new phone with tons of storage, I bought the Apple plan to protect my phone and my wallet. What did I get in exchange? Two nice enough tech kids (one on line and one in the store) who could not help me and a sub par phone that doesn't meet my needs. Let me stress both the tech were ""ok"" by that I mean if everything else had gone right, they would have been fine, but when someone is stressed and needs support they failed to deliver. In fact the tech at the store left me sitting for over an hour with no contact after she brought out the lousy loaner (which she told me was identical to my phone).  I have wasted two days of my vacation dealing with this issue already and will have to take time off from work to go back when Apple is ready to give me a new phone or give mine back. If they return my old phone to me I will never trust it again or use it in the way I have in the past because it totally let me down and caused me to miss an important meeting by dying in the middle of the night. My husband and four kids are all due to update and had planned to get iPhones again, but I don't know if I can allow that. Apple better wow me when they call back or our relationship will end with as soon as I can drop this phone!"

I have a Kindle fire and a Samsung galaxy phone and for both most antiviral programs are free. I do not get it. Why do you have to pay for apps on ipad and all other systems that run like on Android systems they are free. That is greedy somewhere down the line i think that Apple could cut a deal at least to so their customers do not have to pay for apps that are free elsewhere. Not right

cie_B	J T	2017-01-02T23:00:00Z	1	My daughter has had her iPhone 6s for less than 6 months . The screen has stopped working completely so I took it to Apple Braehead. They look at it and said it had deteriorated inside, probably over a few months, possibly because she MAY have used it in the rain. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I asked for £600 should you not be able to use the phone in the rain? I then asked if it would be possible that this damage could have already occurred before she even got the phone but they are refusing to even entertain that idea. They want £270 to replace the handset and I'm refusing to pay that. The phone isn't even a year old. I took it to Glasgow Apple for a second opinion but they never even looked at it. They just read the Braehead notes and sent me on my way.  Disgusted is an understatement in how I am feeling!

I spoke with over 3 members of the Apple team, all were equally helpful.I have to be honest, this was probably the best shopping experience I have had in the past decade. The store was immaculate, the staff were dressed nicely and above all the ambiance was fantastic.A great store and great staff !

I went in today because the screen on my iphone 6 continuously freezes. Based on what I have read online, it is a common problem that Apple is aware of, but has yet to create a solution. Wallace did not even attempt to fix the phone or try to find an inexpensive solution. He did not look at the phone at all. His immediate response was that there was no way to fix the phone and that I would need to pay for a new one if my phone is out of warranty. My question to him was why would a customer have to pay for the phone and then buy a new one due to a design flaw? His response: You don't, unless you're out of warranty. While I understand the purposes of a warranty, this is not a warranty issue. It is an Apple design flaw issue. The customer should not have to pay twice for the same phone nor should a customer service rep refuse to attempt to find a solution."

I didnt have a problem with it. Camera still the same. Then sent it again, this time repaired battery. Now phone comes back, main speaker not working and the front camera.

First of all I was very happy to hear that over the Christmas period they extend the returns policy to allow for the Christmas period so I purchased knowing I could return if the gift wasnt right.In the end I did have to return but their online chat service made it extremely easy for me to return the item - they set up everything on my behalf and instructed me exactly how to get the product returned and refunded.Many big companies really suffer when it comes to customer service but despite Apple being a massive global company I found the customer service to be very efficient and friendly.

cie_B	Jim Williams	2016-12-25T23:00:00Z	1	Long story short. I spent over four hours trying to get my apps updated over 3.47 that I supposedly owed but had already paid. Because of the balance it would not let me update my FREE apps. I am waiting for a new bank card and they insisted I pay the 3.47 or there was nothing they could do. I told them it was wrong double charging me but I would pay double that at this point just to stop the madness. They insisted there was nothing they could do unless I had the new bank info or went out and got an iTunes card. They put me on with a senior supervisor who said the same thing. After four hours of this I finally told them I was an apple customer for 8 years either credit me and take it later which would have been double billing or drop the darn charge. I said at that point do you really want to lose a customer over three dollars. miraculously they dropped the charge I literally 30 seconds and I went on with life All this to update my apps. Four hours of my life I can't get back over 3.47

I've had 3 phone calls and 1 online chat session, and no one from Apple seems able to help me. They all want to start at the beginning and walk me through all the steps that I have already taken. My account is already in recovery. Don't keep sending me to iforgot.apple.com! Please just unlock my phone! Alas, no one at Apple knows what's the verification process entails or how long it will take. Meanwhile, my calendar, contacts, and even flashlight are locked up. So, Merry Christmas to all my contacts who I can't reach. Sorry, or the events I miss because I trusted Apple with my calendar. And my credit card is sorry for the TMobile bill I have to keep paying in expectation of getting my Apple account going soon. I'm also sorry for the prepaid cell phone I had to buy to tie me over until Apple releases my iPhone. I wish Apple would have better communication and warn people that ""Find My iPhone"" is no helpful service because it forever links your phone to an Apple ID, and if you get locked out of that ID you better kiss your phone goodbye. A $600 device sits here, unable to be used - thanks!The security system Apple designed to protect customers is a disaster. Honest customers are being treated very poorly and are ending up frustrated."

However, their customer service is unbelievably horrible and dishonest. I didn't know that and I couldn't imagine that such a reputable neat company could have horrible cystomer service employees who don't give a ** about their customers at all.

I went to get a new password using the ""forgot password"" link and it is hooked up to my old phone. I tried re-formatting my iPad and it still requires my apple id and password. My iPad is now a paper weight!!! It says it is going to take days for apple to approve my apple id and get back to me about changing my password.... it is hooked up to my email!!!!!! That I have access to, I don't understand why it is so hard to reset my password. It is not protecting theft, it is just pointless.... I am very unhappy and feel like I now wasted my money on something I can't even use. I will never ever buy an apple product again and I will never recommend it to anyone!!!!!"
cie_B	Danielle Wilkinson	2016-12-21T23:00:00Z	4	To begin with I was getting very annoyed with the service I was recieving. After having spoken to several people about the issue I had I was getting nowhere. I wasn't impressed when I was told I would be called back and never was but then I called again and spoke to someone named Daniel Lomholt. I was very impressed with the way he dealt with the issue and I was extremely grateful that he was able to solve the issue quickly without any fuss. He was very polite and apologised for the fact that I had been misinformed and messed around. I just wish that he had been the person I had spoken to when I first called apple support as the issue would have then taken a couple of days to sort rather than a few weeks. He managed to give me a better solution than I had hoped for which I was extremely grateful for also.
cie_B	Simona	2016-12-21T23:00:00Z	1	I tried in the last 1 week to buy and apple watch, as a Xmas gift for my boyfriend from the famous Apple website with their PayPal Credit which it is supposed to be ' Easy and instant '. I tried a many time, every time they replied Sorry PayPal Credit isn't available for this purchase, so I just wanted an answer why if they have the offer on their website, right?? so I went in Westfield Shepherds Bush apple shop centre to find out an answer but the people there couldn't give me a proper answer, the only thing they could do it was to suggest to call at the apple phone number from their website so i did that, neither the guy on the phone couldn't help at all, he neither wanted too, he just rushed me away. Then I tried apple Live chat a guy James, this time very kind guy, tried to help and he asked if i made any changes on my PayPal account, and i did, I confirmed again another card, as I thought maybe thats the reason isn't available for me, so James told me i need to wait 48 hours for the accounts to sync. Right, so i waited then tried again, still purchase not available.. I went back on live chat to ask them again, a lady told me better to call paypal. Great, I tried to call paypal but they have an almost non- existent customer service, call centre customer service it is open just from 8am - 4:30pm, or there is another phone number, where a robot answer your phone call and will keep you hours on the phone for nothing.. just repeating same nothing, sorry that’s the truth.. he will never transfer your call to an operate person, so it’s just waste of money on an international call which keeps you forever. I called the second day 8am to speak with an operate person.. first one transferred my call to Paypal Credit department where i was waiting forever, no one picked up the phone.. i hanged up after 15 mins, so again waste of money on international call, and i called again, and finally another guy came with the answer.. after so many days and so much time and money wasted i found my answer why PayPal Credit isnt available for me.. My PayPal account was originally made in a different country than UK, the only think I needed it was to have an UK account and then I could apply and got my answer. So now my answer to them is: the people working for customer service in these two biggest companies in the world, they really don't care or they really don't know what they do!!!! EXtremely Extremely disappointed!!!!

The staff is not knowledgeable nor enthusiastic about sale and answering questions. I always wonder how they get hired. Sometimes I feel like I have done more online research than them. I have to write my review here because apply doesn't have a section for customer to write review or complaint
cie_B	Di Nunweek	2016-12-19T23:00:00Z	1	We have a large family of apple products, imac, macbook, macbook air, iphone 3,5,6 (x2), apple TV (x2),  apple watch.We have had problems with 3 iphones all having been replaced, the imac and apple tv still have issues and a replacement iphone 6 is waiting to be replaced. The products seem very unreliable given the cost and brand status. Repairs in NZ require the product to be sent by courier to an apple repair agent who take some time (weeks) to replace a faulty product.No substitute product is made available during this time, unless you agree to pay significant additional fees.We will be seeking alternative products in the future as do not see the value in apple products any more.

(That was taken from my bank on 5th) So check my bank to double check and yes it was taken. Even called the bank it was definitely paid but apple says it's not. And there is nothing they can do I even offer to send copy of bank statement but no that's not evidence of payment. They can't do anything I just have to pay again. This ridiculous

cie_B	shawn	2016-12-15T23:00:00Z	1	First, the initial order mistake was mine. I ordered a few items from their online store. I clicked the wrong qty. for an item. I did not realize my error until I submitted the order. After I saw what was wrong, I immediately, was on the phone with their customer service department. After about 15 minutes of being on hold, the agent was able to locate my order and basically bend me over her desk. I needed to add one item and reduce the quantity of another item. she told me that even though I just placed my order it was too late to reduce the quantity i would have to do a return and wait for a refund after they received the return. Folks, there is no way someone pulled and shipped my order and it was picked up 15 minutes from the time that i clicked submit. If apple will lie about this small stuff, what do you expect them to do with the big stuff?
cie_B	Lisa C Campbell	2016-12-14T23:00:00Z	1	After spending 20 minutes on the phone to an apple rep, nothing was achieved, and I was even given false information about a store being able to fix my iPhone. When I travelled 30 mins out of my way to get to the store, they couldn't help me without having pre booked an appointment. Terrible service
cie_B	Emily	2016-12-13T23:00:00Z	5	My Apple Watch (series 1) was throwing an error code after I had to disconnect it from updating. I tried reseting it myself but after a day it was still throwing the code. I got onto an online chat with Apple support and it was the fastest and smoothest replacement I've ever had with any product- especially from an online chat. Within five minutes I had them ready to send me a new watch and it even shipped less than 12 hours later! If you want a watch I highly recommend the extra $50 for AppleCare because it was a lifesaver and all I have to do is wait for my new one and send them my old one back! Very satisfied and very impressed with how smooth this all is.
cie_B	Simon	2016-12-12T23:00:00Z	5	I have real issues with understanding the problems people have had with Apple.  As a family we have now gone over to Apple totally (phones, lap tops, desk tops and pads).  Buying from the Apple Store has always been quick, efficient and friendly, and I have yet to find anything out of stock (that's 6 laptops, 2 desk tops, 9 phones and 4 iPads over the past 7 years).  The products last well and have only been replaced due to damage or loss (two laptops, one iPad  and 1 phone) or upgrades in the case of phones (all of the computers still run well).  We have had very few technical issues and the odd ones we have had have be dealt with quickly and free by the Apple store!  Example today (upgrading my wife's MacAir) - we'd like a new mac air please, certainly madam give me two minutes, job done.  We are thinking of having the old one serviced to give to our son, how much do you charge (it is over 5 years old)? Oh nothing madam, let me pop it upstairs while you wait and they will clean the fan and keyboard and check the version of the software and do a virus check while we get the details sorted for your new machine. Fifteen minute later - all done, but we have noticed a slight flaw in your screen on the coating...  Ahh... is that a problem, sounds expensive.  We will need to put a new screen on... sounds very expensive.  No - although it is out of warranty (by a century or so!) this should never happen and we will do it for free - we will need the machine for a couple of hours while you have coffee...  Now - if that is not service what is?  My experience with Sony (my pre-Apple computer of choice) was a disaster.  They would side step every fault (in warranty) where possible unless threatened with legal action and took on average 6 weeks to fix anything.  Apple 10, Sony nil.  I wouldn't buy anything but Apple now.. They are very good, they are expensive, but the service we have had has been faultless and fast.
cie_B	Sartaj Siddiqui	2016-12-12T23:00:00Z	1	I have a Iphone 6, after using it for 6 months the phone started giving me problems. It used to hang, it used to freeze the sensors didn't respond. battery used to drain quickly. So for the same reason I went to the service centre to get the issue fixed they gave me a temporary fix by restoring my phone and when I asked for diagnosis report they gave me and excuse and stated that I can come later if the issue persist as its working fine for now. After using it for another 3 months the issues got more severe, the phone used to get dead for 10-15 minute applications used to crash the battery problem stayed the same, sensors were not responding on time and even my phone got freezed for good 24HRS until the complete battery drained and luckily I was able to  take screenshots of the application crash and the application not responding timely. I went back to the service centre, spoke with someone named Sandeep showed them issue and he said its normal and they will test it for 2 days. I came back and called apple support after 2 days and spoke with Shourya Anand, he called the service centre and they said the phone is ready and they have restored it again and when I asked what was the issue they said it was a software glitch nobody was able to give me alogical reasoning, I insisted that the same thing happened earlier and every time I cannot restore the phone so Shourya insisted me to wait for 2 days as will ask about the diagnostic report and he will call me back. I waited and called apple support to remind them, Shourya called and said he will call me back but he never called me with final report. I spoke with Alisha there after and they said they are working n it and Shourya will call me back and I called back again on the next day and spoke with someone named Nikita I asked her to call service centre to check whats going on and they said they cannot call now so I hung up and ten later i called again and spoke with Himanshi and they said service centre people cannot replicate the issue which i had so its fine now I told her that i have sent the screenshots of phone clearly showing the issue but they still didn't help me. Finally i had a word with Arijit and told him about the same and requested a supervisor he promised that he will look into it and will ask for diagnosis report from service centre and asked me to wait for 2 days so i started waiting and in the mean while i received a call from manager Kaushiki who stated that service centre never ran a diagnosis test and they just restored the phone and they are waiting for them to diagnose it and asked me to wait for Arijit's call. Arijit called me back after 2 days when I called them and reminded that I am waiting and he called me stated that the device is working fine and now the service centre couldn't replicate the issue and they kept on generating diagnoses report from the day 1. I asked him to share diagnoses report and he denied and stated its confidential. Manager's and representative's statement did not match and they kept on lying. My phones diagnosis report cannot be shared with me, there is no logic behind it. Apple support experience was pathetic I paid a good amount for my phone and still they could not provide me average customer service. Apple products and service are pathetic. I neede help and I called several times and nobody helped me nobody gave me a logical answer nobody gave me a reason nobody told me that what exactly was wrong with my problem and what caused it. I reminded Apple support reps to call me back and Shourya Anand gave me his email and when I asked to call me back on he I didn't even reply to it. I don't know about other countries but Apple product and service in India are pathetic no reliable product and no reliable service. They just looting the customers. don't go for it.

I have been repeatedly been given misinformation about timelines by customer service, and Senior Tech Advisors, and have spoken to a ""Manager"" all without any satisfaction. Tonight the Senior Advisor refused to put me through to a manager, and refused to provide me with the information to contact someone else who could assist. My case number is Case: 100074333443. Since my phone is 3 years old now I am due for an upgrade anyway. I've been through a few Macbooks in my years but am preparing to step away from the overpriced cult of Apple. If effective customer care is not part of what I am paying for when I buy these devices, then I may as well take my chances with their competitors' products. Considering the amount of time I have completely wasted with Apple employees in the past week and a half, with no satisfaction at all, and no customer retention interest, I will take my business to someone that doesn't find my business insignificant and not worth supporting."

I wasn't given an option anywhere to log into my account and when I called 2 weeks later once I got back into the country after not having music all that time, all apple customer service could do was keep me on hold for 45 minutes and tell me I hadn't paid my service in 3 weeks so there was absolutely nothing they could do. I was beyond disappointed, confused and frustrated. I will never purchase an apple product again or use an apple service again.

cie_B	Customer	2016-11-21T23:00:00Z	2	The support service from Apple seems to be taking a nose-dive recently.  Here's a run-down of an issue I've had (and am still having) to give you an example;I have a lot of Apple kit; watch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Apple TV... you get the picture - I'm familiar with the devices.My iPhone 6S has been having terrible problems with it's battery recently - since around September the life is poor and it shuts off unexpectedly and suddenly, sometimes when it's as high as 60% charged, and so I have to carry a battery pack around with me everywhere, just in case.  I find that I have to recharge the phone at least twice per day, sometimes three times.  The battery is also on occasion running very hot.  Consequently I contacted Apple a number of times, both in stores and at the support phone centre for help and advice.So far the advice has consisted of;Reboot it (duh - think I haven't already tried that a million times?!)Erase and restore itRestore it as a new device rather than from a backupThe various people I've spoken with have run their diagnostics and reported that there are no errors and the battery appears to be fine (although my experience shows it's far from fine), and so as they can't diagnose a fault they won't repair or replace.Finally this week, after months of battling with the issue Apple have announced that they're aware of a Shutdown Flaw affecting some iPhone 6S devices which has exactly the symptoms I'm experiencing, and so I gleefully called the support team, as I can finally get some support on the issue.  The support guy I spoke with was actually very good and checked my serial number and confirmed that mine was in the batch which has the fault, but really all he could do was book an appointment with a Genius bar as the device would need to be repaired or replaced.  I confirmed I wished to have it replaced as the overheating battery may have affected other components, and realistically I have that option under the UK's Consumer Rights Act.  Unfortunately there were only 3 slots open in the London Covent Garden store, a week away.  As I really wanted this resolved sooner the advisor suggested I drop in to an Apple store and speak to a manager, as it was a relatively easy resolution; simply swap the device for a new one - Apple already know it has a manufacturing fault so no diagnostics are needed.As advised, I dropped into the London Regent Street branch (slightly easier to get to for me than Covent Garden) and asked for a manager, and was directed to a Mr Sharma. The 'manager' seemed to have difficulty understanding the story and was intent on making me a Genius bar appointment, for which he had a 5-6 hour waiting list.  I tried to explain that I didn't need any technical help, I just needed a replacement, but he wasn't listening.  He was rude and dismissive, and when I told him that I didn't want to wait for 5 hours he told me to leave the store as I didn't have any business being there if I didn't want to have technical help or buy a product!As I'd been unsuccessful at Regent Street I proceeded straight over to Covent Garden and again asked for a manager, adding some background for him and my thoughts about how Apple support was worsening - he didn't like that I wasn't happy with the service, but instead of sympathising and trying to recover the situation he seemed to become aggravated - not a great way for a 'manager' to deal with a consumer.  He did, however, get me to a Genius bar technician about an hour later.When I finally sat down with the Genius bar technician he didn't perform any diagnosis, he simply booked it for a replacement (which could have been done on the phone, or by any of the members of Apple staff I'd spoken to already), however as it's their standard policy booked it for a recycled device, despite my understanding that I would receive another new device to replace my faulty one.  As they don't hold stock I have to return in 3-5 days to swap it over.After leaving the store I checked with Which's legal team and they confirmed that under the Consumer Rights Act I do have the right to demand a brand new device, as that's what I purchased, and so I called the support team again.  After spending 40 minutes on the phone with them the senior advisor finally worked out that I'd need to speak to Covent Garden again about ensuring the replacement was for new and not recycled and transferred me to the branch.  A woman answered, said 'hello? hello?' and then hung up.I'm on to the support team again, this time I'm 24 minutes in and still nowhere.Not sure what I have to do to get Apple to resolve this.  Right now I'd settle for them even fulfilling their legal obligations.After decades of using Apple and tens of thousands of pounds of expenditure I'm about ready to stop using Apple entirely.  Great hardware but atrocious customer service when things go wrong.  It's hardly 'it just works', it's more 'when it doesn't work it's a nightmare'.
cie_B	Tim	2016-11-15T23:00:00Z	2	"I'm done. 5 iPhones and two iPads later I'm done. The deceptive trade practices in the form of ""updates"" is finally enough. Being a huge fan and supporter of apple products has become increasingly difficult. I'm tired of my technology investments becoming gradually slower and bug riddled by updates. It is my opinion there are two primary reasons for the constant updates. One is spying via data mining and the other is the gradual pursuit of eventually outdating products via updates. So I'll purchase a dumb phone next time I need one and no more purchases through the Apple Store. Apple, you have officially been boycotted from this point forward. I'm sick of the constant pop up screens informing me I need to update. So please ""update"" your customer list and remove one person. More will follow."
cie_B	Mwilly	2016-11-13T23:00:00Z	3	I own an iPad and iPhone and using them for quite a long time already. +for quality +for functionality +for styling. However I`m here to say they kinda failed with latest devicces. Hope the situation gets better.UPD on the latest models:too overpriced, lack some functions other companies issued for the top phones this year. I guess it becomes more of a marketing matter now, sadly :( Will see on release anyway, they still have time to improve.
cie_B	Allen	2016-11-11T23:00:00Z	1	I went to the apple store in Ottawa to get advice about something. I asked the employee a question and he literally started yelling at me in front of the entire store. The entire time he was talking he was just repeating the same thing over and over again as if I was too dumb to understand what he was trying to say. It felt like he was trying to get rid of me as soon as possible. I am not kidding I felt like crying because his tone was so harsh. I was appalled at his behavior and I honestly cannot believe that anyone would ever pay him to talk to customers. If I was his manager I would fire him immediately. He is an absolute atrocious disgrace to Apple and I seriously hope he loses his job because I never ever want to encounter him at the Apple store ever again. WORST ABSOLUTE APPLE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For third time this morning, I just waited 15 minutes before hanging up.  They do not give you the option to leave your number and have them call you.  Obviously they are saving $ by not having enough CS reps, or maybe their products are needing far too much help.  Neither excuse matters.  Their customer service in unacceptable.
cie_B	Harry D	2016-11-01T23:00:00Z	1	They are keep updating their IOS and forcing devices to update software which is making those devices to run slow and need to buy a new one every old customer they can't use old device no longer. For their bussiness stealing money from costomer. Better to stop forcing and signing on old IOS for that compatable device which makes those devices run faster. And feel apple as better. They will switch to new phones one they feel the futures are nice in new phone don't force them to buy ne phone on next relese. People are already crazy they will buy any how. But who don't have enough  money you are stealing them. You are steeling from poor and middle class people. Don't force them and try help to full fill their hopes.  People were thinking they ware also in good position by usin your phones. But you want them to buy new one every time which they cannot spend that much money every time. Please be fair to poor and middle class people.
cie_B	Melissa McBride	2016-10-31T23:00:00Z	5	My iPhone 6 stopped working yesterday as the screen went black and wouldn't turn back on, it was effectively dead.I went to the store in Belfast Victoria square 3 times today.First time I went I was told I would need an appointment so they booked me a walk in appointment, I was distressed with the lack of my phone as now a days you need it for everything and depend on it which in a way is quite sad.So the girl told me to come back after 11:40 and since my lunch was between 12 and 1pm, I went at that time. I didn't get seen to and became very angry as since I was a walk in appointment and was told I would only be seen to if someone was free but aside from that I got ignored.I then went in the evening after work where I said that this is my 3rd time and needed my phone to work or something to be sorted. Luckily a kind fella said ok that's fine and was very apologetic, offered me a seat and then just explained that within 20 minutes someone would be out. Luckily enough a girl named Katherine came out and helped me with my issue. We had a nice chat and due to her discretion of me since my phone wasn't in bad condition, she kindly gave me a replacement phone and waived the fee even though it was out of warranty!!!! I can't thank Katherine and the store enough as now I am sorted and it's like my old phone never broke.I see the negative comments and understand that but in my own experience I can't think of any other company who would be so kind to give a free phone out of warranty!! Thank you!!! :D

cie_B	Mike Jaega	2016-10-23T22:00:00Z	5	Most people complain about Apple but still have an iPhone, iPad etc.  Most problems arise from not understanding how to use these devices therefore most people complain about what is essentially their own error in not backing up the device properly before updating etc.  I use Apple devices for business and the way iCloud syncs is brilliant! They are simple to use, easy and very user friendly! I've also found their customer service to be of a very high standard too. Of course it has its problems but nothing is perfect but I'd never go back to anything Windows again if I could help it. MS anything is clunky, slow, updates every two mins when you least need them when needing to finish an important report etc. Plus a nightmare to back up and restore! Why can't everything be as simple as Apple! Technology should be fun, not require a degree in rocket science to work first. Yes they are expensive and work needs to be done to make things more affordable but hats off to apple for making computing fun and stylish again. It's actually a pleasure to work with Apple devices.

It is incredibly slow when multitasking, pictures appear after a half second. And. Hanging from facebook to messenger app takes 10 seconds.. I've had an 8 year relationship with apple as a loyal costumer. Now had my 6'th iPhone and bought a MacBook Pro. I never thought it would get to this, but now apple have taken a crap on me one time too many. So now I'm on the lookout for a Samsung phone or something, and my MacBook won't be replaced with a mac - windows will get that order, that is for sure. The reason I got a mac was because I didn't like the constant pop ups and my computer is old now, and I must admit that it has been living a 6 year life. My iPhone is only two weeks old, it is the second iPhone 6 I've owned, but it will also be the last one..Steve Jobs knew what he was doing, and now Tim Cook will ruin it.. I'm over and out, that is for sure..

The next guy told me 5 more minutes. Waited for another hour before I just gave up and left. My computer was working fine before the new OS update and I'm sure I'm going to have to pay a high price for something that's not my fault. Get a black screen every time I turn it on.
cie_B	Catherine Green	2016-10-19T22:00:00Z	1	I hate this company. I purchased an ipad 3yrs ago. Due to a software update i have this annoying pop up box asking me for an Apple id verification every 20secs which is linked to an old email address that I cannot access. In order to fix this Apple asked for proof of purchase. I have provided a bank statement, email from Amazon confirming the purchase AND an email with an invoice from the original company that supplied it to me. Because that invoice is not on an official company letterhead Apple are refusing to accept that I have provided them with a proof of purchase. What a load of bloody nonsense. How many receipts are on non official letterheads? Loads. Get real. It's a proper audit trail that would stand up in court any day of the week. Look at the till receipts you get from supermarkets, shops etc. Are they not proofs of purchase? Of course they are. They essentially want me to buy another product from them. I REFUSE TO DO SO. I'm going to buy a Samsung tablet instead. Just as good at half the price.  AVOID THIS COMPANY THEY NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN A PEG OR TWO

cie_B	Kunal Sanghavi	2016-10-16T22:00:00Z	1	I booked an iPhone on 21st Sept online which was supposed to be delivered on 23rd Sept to a hotel where my friend was staying. He needed to leave hotel on 24th. I had called into apple support and asked them if the phone would be delivered on 23rd since he needed to leave and they promised it would! 23rd Sept (a few hours before expected delivery) they call me and say it hasn't left factory and will be leaving shortly. I tell them I need it delivered today and they said it should reach if the delivery is 23rd. I wait till EOD and no phone. I call again and explain the scenario to a new support guy. He tells me I can go for pick up option. He checks the store next to hotel and says there have the phone in stock in that store. I was like, book it. This happens at 10.00 am. Friend needed to move to different hotel post dinner so he could pick it up by 7.00 pm. Support guy tells me it will be available by 2.00 pm. I agree and book the phone. 4.00 pm, no mails about pick up ready. I call up again and they say they are preparing the package. I call back at 5.00 pm and same answer. 6.00 pm my friend goes to store, and they still didn't have it ready!!! They make him wait for an hour and still are doing things on the inside. He leaves at 7.00 pm without the phone!I get an email on 24th that the phone is on its way and will reach on 27th. I call them immediately asking them to cancel the delivery. Support guy tells me they will try calling UPS and stop the shipment. I agree and wait for their update. Still no call. I call them back and the new support guy doesn't see any of my previous conversation so I have to explain all over. I ask him to give me a call back after talking to UPS. He calls me back saying UPS are on their way and there is no way to cancel the shipment. I will need to return it once the phone is delivered. They give me a support manager to talk to - Mel.I call the hotel staff myself and tell them the story. They say they will give it to UPS person (as shipments come in daily) for return. Phone gets delivered to hotel on 27th and the hotel agrees to return it on 28th. I call Apple again giving the update. Now, Mel tells me I need to call back after a few days to confirm they got the phone. I said NO WAY! I need you guys to call me and update me. 4-5 days pass (4th Oct) and no calls. I track the delivery and phone has been delivered to their factory 2 days back!I call them for 6th or 7th time and Mel casually say oh yes, phone was delivered blah blah. I was like, this support sucks. They made a mistake to send it out late, then didn't give a s*** for return. I was like I need my refund since my credit card payment date is on 11th Oct. Mel tells me they will check the phone is it is not damaged or not used, etc and then confirm if its good for a refund. I lost it, totally lost it. I was like it wasn't even opened! Mel still doesn't give a s*** and says I can't help you.I call back on 7th Oct asking for an update. I shout this time and let them know enough is enough. Now, the Mel tells me that he will call the clearance department and get back to me. He calls me back in 2 hours and tells me I should receive a refund in next 2-3 days. On 9th Oct, I get an email saying phone has been cleared and I should get a refund within 5 business days. This also contradicts the promise made to me by Mel. So, I was supposed to get the refund by 14th. I still haven't got it and I called Mel YET AGAIN. He tells me it's been 6 days and I should have got the refund already. He calls back in an hour and tells me the ADMIN guy who is supposed to post refund didn't do it till now and will do it now.I was like what the hell is wrong with you guys!!! Nobody gives a s***. Now, I need to pay my credit card bill with more charges and I still haven't got the money back. SUMMARY - No phone through online booking or store pickup, wasted money on both the options, had to call 10+ times. Got refund for pick up store phone but still no money for online booking. It's been 8 days and still nothing!!!This is the WORST experience ever!!!
cie_B	Bob	2016-10-14T22:00:00Z	1	"I have an Apple iPhone not out of choice, but it is because it is the only phone my company permit for accessing their exchange servers.The screen became unresponsive after five months of use.  The phone had been looked after and in excellent physical condition.I went online and did a support chat.  Was advised to restore the phone using iTunes.  I did this, and the problem persisted.  I was then asked to take it to an Apple store.  Problem was that none of the local Apple stores had any availability to see a ""Genius"".  I kept trying and eventually one came up at the White City store.  Not local, but I needed a repair, so I made arrangements to travel there.I had an appointment at 4.20pm.  As I walked in to the store, a man with an iPad had a queue of 5 or so people.  I waited patiently for my turn.  When I got to the front of the queue, I told the man with his iPad that I was booked for a repair and he told me that I was in the wrong place.  I had to walk over to the Genius Bar and see one of his colleagues there.  He didn't say why he couldn't book me in, perhaps he was not trained to press the check-in button on his iPad. Who knows, but he clearly wasn't a Genius.I walked over to the Genius Bar.  There were lots of people with iPads, but I did not know which one was the Genius that could check me in.  I floated around hoping that someone would spot me and help but no one did.  I plucked up the courage and spoke to a Genius with an iPad.  They might have been a trainee Genius because they couldn't press the check-in button either, and they told me to speak to Carlos instead.How did I find Carlos?  None of the Geniuses wore name badges?  Should I shout his name I thought?  I saw another Genius, so I asked him if he was Carlos and fortunately he said he was.  I asked him to check me in and he refused as I was 10 minutes early.  He asked me to go away and come back in 10 minutes.  I sat down and waited patiently for ten minutes to pass.  I then went to back to Carlos to check me in, only to be told that there was a 30 minute wait as they were running behind schedule.  I was told to wait again....Finally I was called to the Genius Bar and I took my seat.  A Genius came along and I explained the problem.  He got to work running diagnostics and confirmed that there was a fault with the screen and he booked the phone in for a repair.  I was told it would be about 2 hours to repair.  I had a couple of coffees to pass the time.  When I came back I was told that the repair had not been done and to come back the following morning.  I went home feeling very sad.The following morning, I checked the repair status online and it said that the phone was still being repaired.  At lunchtime the status was still the same.  I decided to call and sat on hold for an hour - the hold music was pleasant, unlike Patricia who I eventually spoke to.  To my surprise, she said that the phone had been repaired the previous day!  So why was I told to come back in the morning?  Why did the online system say it was still being repaired?  What a waste of time.  I said that I wanted to complain, but Patricia refused to take my complaint - she asked me to come into the store and complain there.  She was adamant that she could not record a complaint or take a message for a manager to call me back.  I have a recording of the conversation and it is shocking how I was talked down to and my requests to have a complaint logged were ignored.  I am considering putting this recording onto YouTube as a warning to others and for its comedic value.  If I wasn't so annoyed, I would have laughed out loud.I collected my phone the following day as I could not get back to White City due to work commitments.  You can imagine my surprise when I set it up only to find that the repaired phone was still faulty!  Perhaps it was down to the ""it has been repaired"" / ""it hasn't been repaired"" confusion.I went back online to find out how to get it fixed.  An Online Chat person discussed my options.  Option 1 - Postal repair would take 10 days and no replacement would be provided.  Option 2 - Book a slot to see another Genius in store, but there were no appointments available at any store within 15 miles.  Option 3 - walk into my local Apple store and beg them to sort out the problem.  I chose option 3.  I travelled to Watford Apple Store and explained my problem to the local Genius with an iPad.  He put me on a waiting list and I received a text message telling me that I was in a queue; it wasn't a physical queue, so I couldn't see how long it was.  After waiting 20 minutes, I asked how much longer I would have to wait, but the Genius did not know - perhaps a lesser Genius?Two hours later, a Genius came out and called my name.  He wanted me to demonstrate the fault.  I explained that it was intermittent but my Genius wanted me to demonstrate it - he didn't trust me.  I explained the meaning of the word intermittent, but I don't think he really understood.  As often happens, when my Genius walked away for a moment, the phone fault manifested itself.  I shouted out at another Genius and showed him my phone not responding - he must have thought I was mad, but I did not fancy spending another hour trying to replicate the fault in front of my Genius.  When my Genius returned, I told him that I reproduced the fault and it was witnessed by another Apple Genius - the Geniuses spoke to each other and I breathed a sigh of relief - the fault had been confirmed.  My Genius ran some Apple diagnostics on my iPhone and it come up clear - No fault found!  Oh dear - what now?  I am told the handset is okay but the software is the problem.  I explain that I have reset my phone several times and performed the iTunes restore too.  He doesn't believe me and he insists that he must perform a restore.  So he goes off to get a laptop.  It felt like he was calling me a liar. Now I am annoyed, very annoyed.  How much more time do I need to spend trying to get a phone repaired?  Many other companies would just take the faulty phone and replace it.  But not Apple; profits before people, profits before customers, profits profits profits.My Genius started restoring my phone, saying that procedures must be followed. He then went onto say words like ""Process"", ""Follow"", ""Apple"".  I began to wonder whether he was a Cyborg, so I let him do what he was programmed to do.  The key point is that my Cyborg Genius and his manager did not trust me.  I am not a liar, I had a faulty iPhone and I had restored it, it was in its factory default mode, and it did not respond to touch intermittently.Having wasted in excess of 12 hours at this point to get a phone repaired, I had lost my cool.  Even the manager that I spoke to had an attitude.  Apple have got to be the worst for customer care.  It is impossible to complain to them formally - they don't even seem to have a complaints department!  Most companies have Customer Care, but not Apple, they have Applecare, but that says it all - they only care about Apple, not the customers.After much stress and wasted time, Apple did eventually swap my phone and I did get a verbal apology from a manager at the store.  But this wasted my time and caused me inconvenience.  It has also wasted the Genius' time, and probably caused delays to other waiting customers, but I don't think Apple really care (perhaps they should rebrand support to AppleDon'tCare).  I am a very unhappy customer! At £50 an hour, which is what I charge my time out at, this repair has taken 12 hours of my time.  That is a cost of £600, or the price of an Apple iPhone 6S Plus.  Perhaps that should be the compensation for treating a customer like trash, wasting their time and calling them a liar.Keep a lookout on Youtube, for the phone call with White City's Patricia.   A member of Apple's finest that refuse to take note of a customer's legitimate complaint.I also accidentally recorded the encounter with the Genius and manager at Watford with my other phone.  I feel the only way to get things to improve is to publish.  If it doesn't achieve that goal, then it might serve as a warning to other potential customers.Caveat Emptor"
cie_B	Artur Bellgrau	2016-10-13T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely nightmare! Every day there is several popups on the screen to access photos, access that and that. I was p....ed off that! And once I clicked ''do not allowed'' with hope that those popups will stop and....another pop came up with to enter Apple password! Well, I do not use apples store at all so its normal that I forgotten it. That starts two month of nightmare and eventually lost my I phone 5!!!!!!! It took me to a recovery account where it asked me to enter digits send to my other trusted phone ( my wives one) which I entered without problems than it took me to a page asking to enter my associated credit card.  - My card were renewed long time ago and was in the bin two years ago! Well, There was a chance to go trough the recovery process and awaiting instruction send to my trusted phone ( NOTE they said it takes few days!!!!). Within one month I did it 3 times and those info never came to my trusted( my wives) phone!!!! I have called customer service! and was told to provide proof of purchase of my phone? Why the hell online apple account to access games is associated with my phone???????? F..ck! If my phone is stolen than I should talk to the EE where I bought it right? ?Problem is that I bought this phone 3 years ago and do not have those papers to proof I bought it!  Apple meant to be user -friendly! It is not at all by all means! If I got an access to my personal email and (on top of it) to my trusted phone number( my wives one) plus still I am able to use my personal phone number ( using my sim with Samsung phone) than it should not be that problem right? It is easier to renew bank details and password than with apple!!!!!! They know my number why dont they text me with my new apple password? Why wont they send a link to my private email? Why dont they post a letter with a recovery password to my home address???????????????????????????????????????????????????? If you do not want to have problems with loosing your phone, not because someone stole it but because of Apples incompetence than NEVER BUY APPLE! So long Apple there is so many other phones available on the market! You have just lost a loyal customer who was with you for years!!!!!!

cie_B	Ericste1	2016-10-08T22:00:00Z	1	My I pad has been my computer and companion since 2012. From the moment I unpacked it and switched it on I was sold. The move back from Australia to the U.K. has been difficult but my I pad has kept me informed and in touch. For my needs which are e mail, web browsing, you tube, music, and photos it has been superb. On several occasions I've researched a back up device and almost bought an expensive wireless system which I was led to believe would store and back up my I pad content. I never did purchase one and I'm still confused if spending the £100 plus pounds would have been the solution because I kept getting conflicting information. I recently returned from Australia with many superb photos of family, friends and snaps of the places I lived in Australia as well as some stunning images including early morning balloons passing overhead on a cold winter Melbourne day. These images are all now gone and will only remain as memories in my head. Over 4 years worth of electronic photos, my entire photo library except for 55 of the most recent shots have been  wiped.A week or so after returning from Australia my I pad froze. I couldn't switch it off. It was re booted at the Apple Store but my photos came back as blank grey squares. At first I wasn't too concerned and my brother advised to keep it connected to power and they will eventually download. This didn't happen. Stupidly confident I returned to an Apple Store and the consultant advised another re boot. Same grey squares but no photos. His advice was to call support where the advisor was pretty useless. While on the phone to him and scrolling through all my blank photo squares I was still extremely confident that my photo library was there somewhere and could be WOULD BE RECOVERED. Shortly after this call all my grey squares vanished. I will never know why those grey squares which were at least evidence that something had been there suddenly disappeared. This was the moment that I felt empty and lost. In fact I felt physically sick. Over 4 years of my life which I believed to be safe in the cloud, ALL GONE. A senior consultant, who has been an absolute gem to deal with as have most of the Apple staff has now left a message telling me that engineers are unable to recover my images. While waiting to speak to someone at the Apple Store I was explaining my situation to a youngish Apple employee. She abruptly cut me off saying I haven't got time to go into this now adding and this is what really pisses me off......WE ALWAYS ADVISE YOU TO BACK UP TO A COMPUTER.Excuse me......MY I PAD IS MY COMPUTER. I Don't have a lap top and I CLOUD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BACK UP. I feel absolutely devastated because I loved my I pad and I trusted I cloud.It's crazy to think that we have become so connected to these electronic devices and very sad to be left feeling so empty inside. As empty as my photo library. Apple should not be selling I pad on its own and should be making it clear that you need a mac book as well if you want to ensure your stuff is secure. Hopefully the market will determine how much longer Apple can continue to be so expensive and so arrogant. To think I was about to up grade my I pad but what's the point without having a mac book as well and I can't afford it. I could keep my current I pad hoping it won't freeze again and invest in a mac book but why should I have to spend all this money. Money I don't have and why should I spend another penny in an Apple Store.Update on my case with Apple. As expected I've been told that my I cloud was not configured correctly to save photos. If they mean by configured switching on I cloud photo, then it's ridiculous to think that I would have gone into settings and left it off. I've also checked their terms and conditions. Of course they cover themselves completely in large capitals while in small print state it's your responsibility to back up to another computer. My I pad is my only computer. This is not just about the loss of my photos, it's about the trust I placed in the company and their products.I will never buy another Apple product. It won't make any difference to them but it will save me a lot of money.
cie_B	George Stone	2016-10-05T22:00:00Z	1	"Unbelievably dire service from Apple Store Bromley over the last couple of weeks.We booked an appointment for a screen repair at 12pm on the 25th September, which was to be reimbursed by a third party insurance company. We arrived 10 minutes early with the anticipation of being seen early or at least on time. We were told to sit down and come back up at 12, which we did.The representative signed us in and notified us that Apple's systems were down on that day, but that they should still be able to proceed with the repair, it would simply mean that they'd need to do more of the paperwork manually as opposed to electronically, which was fine.We ended up waiting for 45 minutes for someone to call us up to the Genius Bar (you could see the frustration on everyone else's faces). The guy that we spoke with ran us through some paperwork, quoted the work and told us to return at 2:40pm and it should be done (2 hours for the work, which wasn't too bad given that this is the time they suggest to allow anyway). We return at precisely 2:30pm and let them know that we were there to collect the phone, but were happy to wait given that we were a little early anyway. After being told that it shouldn't be too long, we then went back up to one of the reps at 3:15pm to inform him that we had been waiting for well over half an hour. He said he would go to check for us and never bothered returning to let us know what was happening. Finally at 3:40pm the engineer came out with our phone. At this point he explained that due to the fault with their systems, he would need to put the receipt down as a gift card receipt. We explained that we were planning to make an insurance claim and he told us that if we called when the systems were back up and running, they'd get us a receipt no problem.The following weekend, we called Apple Customer Service. The representative told me that she was unable to help, but if I emailed the Bromley branch they'd get back to me within 24 hours. Surprise surprise, 5 days later and we've heard nothing even still, so I called them yesterday evening instead. After 45 minutes on the phone, I was told that they weren't able to do this but decided amongst them that the insurance company ""should accept the statement of work/quote and the gift card receipt combined"" (not sure who they thought they were to decide the insurance company's policy for them). I absolutely insisted that they produced a receipt for me and the rep decided that she would speak with the store manager. Finally, she came back and told me that he had agreed to get the receipt across to me first thing today, on the basis that the store was closing and he didn't have the resources he needed at the time to do it.At this point I was truly disgusted at the service that I had received from a company that has one of the largest customer bases in the world, and arguably one of the largest yearly revenues as well. I have contacted my insurance company this evening in the anticipation that they MIGHT accept the quote and gift card receipt combined, however the rep told me that this would be unlikely but to give it a shot regardless.I am pending their answer, and to this moment have not received an ounce of help with Apple. If it was not for the fact that Apple produce such innovative technology, I would not use their services in a million years."
cie_B	Jaime Blasco	2016-10-05T22:00:00Z	5	"I've been a MacBook user for many many years, and only a couple times I had a small issue, both of them fixed by Apple quickly. Then it came the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad or the Apple Watch. I've never had a single problem with any of them, I know that some products are expensive, but I'm well aware that the extra cost gives you durability and longevity instead.Do you want an equipment that last for several years? Then buy Apple. Forget about the design or being ""cool"". Apple means high quality tech, meant to keep working under pressure without crack."

I have yet to have an iPhone with no problems (currently on my third version, but 7th phone due to needing replacements caused by software malfunctions). Apple will not care about this review because people will continue to buy these ""user friendly"" devices regardless. This company causes me so much frustration."
cie_B	Fredrik	2016-09-27T22:00:00Z	1	Apple's customer support does so many things wrong. I have a soundcard purchased from apple store that stopped working correctly after about a year and a half. Since apple apparently doesn't even have an email address for their support here, I have to contact by phone (sounds a lot like they just want to dissuade customers from using their rights) which costs me time and money. After nearly 30 minutes on the phone (20 being put on hold) I finally receive the response that I have to contact the manufacturer of the card and that they are unable to help me. Will not buy directly from apple ever again.

While making products for the ""consumer artist"" is not a bad thing. At least a few products that cater to the Professionals.  No real updates to the Mac Pro's is a problem."

I went to get my new phone today and when I got there, they (store managers and corporate) told me that I have to pay $55 for Apple just to send me my old broken phone back to me so I can swap it out for the new one. And they new they were the ones to make the mistake and even though they recognized that, they still are making me pay for it. They claimed it was Company Policy and that they ""can't do anything about it."" They are making me pay for their mistake. This is just absolutely ridiculous. Thanks for nothing Apple. I don't suggest anyone go to Perimeter Mall in Georgia location. They will mess up what should have been an easy fix and you'll have to pay for their mistake yourself. Ridiculous."

cie_B	Jasmine Alexia Simmons	2016-09-22T22:00:00Z	2	"Apple needs Steve back: I always find under ""new management"" to be the worst. I try to be fair, but I'm also just. I understand Steve Jobs isn't here and won't be coming back (rest his soul), but Apple must chill. EVERY time you turn around there's a ""new"" iPhone. Where? Where is the new iPhone, Apple? You adjust the camera, maybe add some pigmentation to the backlight, or there's some promise of 'improvement' in the system altogether. How is that new? How IPHONE, how!? You overprice your items and you over produce a name that stands as a great functioning system without you guys always tinkering away on something I find to be useless. Another ""home"" app that's unnecessary or an IOS update that's always CHANGING everything. You take away small, but useful tweaks and auction it off as a ""step up"" when all it does is irritate me. LEAVE THE PHONE ALONE, and focus on things that matter, like actually making the Alarm work. Can we start there? Or adding personalization that isn't so constricting and BORING. Yes, this review was written with anger, but again, we're drawn back to my statement about fairness, but to be ""just"" as well. I try to give the new updates a chance, for one, they're too frequent to ignore and one (myself) starts to see a decline in performance to where I'm forced to upgrade, and for two, I'm hoping that Apple will fix their gaps in their operating system. Each time, I'm disappointed and I've been with Apple for years. Loyalty keeps me here as opposed to switching to Android, but I've thought on many occasions to just doing it anyways and saving myself the headache of another ""iPhone release"". I understanding having to keep up with demands of a fast paced market, but it gets to a point where you guys start to overlook the needs of the customers to fill your own pockets...and call it capitalism all you want, but it's the consumer that keeps the company at bay. The IPhone 7 is a joke and I have an IPhone 6. I haven't even had this iPhone long enough to be comfortable, let alone think about an upgrade. The replacement of the headphone jack was ridiculous and all part of some ploy to give the phone something ""new"", but again ""unnecessary"". Marketing Apple Wireless EarPods? Really? What if they fall out? Is there a tracking system? Or perhaps an automatic refund when they're lost in the shuffle of life? I doubt it, Apple, I doubt it. Have several seats and just enjoy being a great company that honestly does make great products. You've substained your name already and it's known worldwide, so give your users a chance to enjoy it, otherwise continue to decline in not only my eyes, but a slow gradually accumulation of other users as well."

Then I went to the emergency room with my son who accidently knocked my phone onto the carpeted floor, cracking my glass front . I thought I'm going to have to keep this dodgy upgrade after 10 days. I had a live chat with Sharon then a man called Hil Hackworth who helped me. I am now getting sent a replacement phone . Thank You Apple. Steve Jobbs obviously affected more than the tech world, he touched peoples hearts.

cie_B	Daniel Herczeg	2016-09-12T22:00:00Z	5	Bought my MacBook Pro back in 2013 for work and it didn't get slower since then. It even got faster than it was, when I first unboxed it, due to the OS X updates, released since then. No Windows PC/Laptop I had (and I owned one or two over the last 10 years) was nearly as good as my Macintosh computer.But it's not just the products that make Apple good. The customer support is great and you get a lot of goodies for free. I actually don't even have to use any 3rd party software on my mac, if I don't want to. You get everything you need for free, like a complete set of office applications.Customer support is great. Contacted it several times the last 5 years. The first time, 2011, I had a problem with my itunes account. The support answered the same day and helped me with my problem. I also got a gift card for the music store, because my library was accidentally deleted. Of course they also restored my purchases and my library!Needless to say that I'm quite sure that I won't be buying any smartphone or computer that was not made by apple in the future.Yes, the products are expensive, but they last at least 5 years (I'm quite sure even a lot longer) and you can sell them for a lot of money after 5 years.
cie_B	Joseph	2016-09-12T22:00:00Z	1	"Today I ordered an MacBook Air which I found BestBuy.ca is selling it for $200 less than Apple.ca. I called Apple and they refuse to match the price. They cannot cancel the order therefore they wish for me to visit a local Apple store and return it for a refund. Therefore Apple wants either $200 more or for me to spend $25 gas, $7.00 toll for highway and my time to return their product when an Authorized Reseller ""BESTBUY"" can sell it for less. How does this make any sense and where is Steve Jobs"

Teddy (the technician) deleted my email account (instead of disabling !) and I have now lost all my folders and documents. The only answer I got from him and the 2 managers (after being there for 4 hours !) was ""we are sorry but you will have to sort it out by yourself with Infomaniak"". What kind of service is that ? the whole thing worked fine before my visit Apple Genius (yes indeed..) now I'm left with the problem to solve on my own 1) because it is week-end and 2) ""because Monday we cannot take you as there will be a lot of customer with the new iphone""... So in other words F...off with your MacBookAir and your Iphone 6, you are not important enough !.. I'm so disappointed and angry."

cie_B	Rajani Siddhanti	2016-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	To start with I (personally) don't buy any Apple product because I think they are overpriced for what they actually are!  After my experience (explained below) with Apple product and their customer service, now I feel, that my decision of not buying any Apple product is absolutely correct.Due to the demand from my daughter I bought an iPod Touch (I think Gen 6) in Nov 2015.  It worked fine till July 2016.One fine day, it just died!....  We thought that the cable is the problem so bought a new cable.  Did not work.  Changed the charger, did not work.  All in all, we tried all possible ways to revive it but all in vain....    We took the product back to PCWorld (from where we bought the product) and they told us to contact Apple for support.Lets begin the sad story....We thought of visiting an Apple shop which is 45 minutes’ drive away from us.  Thinking that we'll get our problem sorted!  Since we are new to Apple world we didn't know the rules to follow.  In the store we were told to contact Apple Customer Service and they don't have any appointment for that day!  What?!  Appointment?!....My wife contacted Apple customer support over the phone.  She was given a case number (D207607179) and yes due to an error on our side (i.e. she did not have the Apple ID and password) we had to call back again with the required details.Second time when my wife called, the English language knowledge of the customer service executive was pathetic.... My wife reached to a stage (after around 40 minutes) where she asked the executive to transfer the call to another person who can understand/speak English.We were told that someone will come and collect the product.  Nobody turned up....  When we checked the repair status online, we realised that we have been shipped an empty box from Apple and we have to send the product back.We have not dropped the iPod or something of that sort.  It just stopped working.  On the other hand, I have a phone (Asus) which is lot cheaper than an Apple product (and lot better than Apple product).  I have dropped it numerous times, it is still working absolutely fine.We think, the process we have to follow to fix a simple issue is like killing a bee with a sledge hammer….Looks like Apple only cares about sales.  After sales customer server?!  What is that??????Let's hope for the best.

cie_B	Dustin Palmer	2016-09-01T22:00:00Z	1	This company does not know when to stop eating all other companies and biting off more than they can chose. This is due to their disconnection from their buyers. I had a pair of beats that went defective, and apple told me to drop them to the local best buy which services apple products. They checked in my item with receipt (and registered serial online), and they were mailed back un repaired as best buy only services beats products from their store. This is unbelievable and totally a great reason why I do not support this company in the least. I guess way less then the little I did before. But if you buy a company and assume the warranties, you should give accurate information on where to get them mailed out for warranty. I told the best buy associates to throw them out as it was my mistake for wasting my money on a product from a company that has no care for product support. I have had better experiences with smaller companies like skull candy which are a fraction of the cost in regards to a warranty. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BOGOUS COMPANY!!!!!

The only thing that prevents me giving a 5-star review is that even though online support is great, calling their support centre can be an unpleasant experience, with them leaving you on hold for a long time, although it's not as bad as Microsoft support. When you do get put through quickly, however, their team is pleasant, friendly and helpful.

cie_B	Gary R Beal	2016-08-10T22:00:00Z	1	"Name an Apple product and I probably own multiple units....6S? MacAir, MacPro, 27"" Retina iMac...I have at least 4 of each of these.The last several years though I have had service issue after service issue and the support is just terrible. The iCenter staff could give a ratsass...only if you are buying.Beside to iPhones I paid €850 each for at the Arkadia Malta iCenter store I also bought my iMac and 2 MacAir's there. I have problems with them all.Let's just take the brand new MacAir I bought May 0th. As I said I have many computers, 11 laptops alone, so I used this for 2 conferences because of the mobility benefits and after those it sat unused on my desk. This desk also holds a 400"" Samsung, 2 Mac Pros, a Windows machine and my iMac. So things do not spill or fall or get jarred around.This specific day I was actually working on it for 4 hours. Suddenly the screen was all messed up and looked like a motherboard issue from past experience.I had maybe 20 hours on this laptop.Sent it off, 3 weeks later the engineer calls and says it the retina display and looks like it was dropped. When I dropped it off the clerk mentioned, and noted in his repair form that it was in perfect condition. No dents from dropping, NOTHING.Yet this engineer continually avoids the question I keep answering,""How else might something like this happen because it was just sitting there for 2 weeks, used for 3 house and then this.The result? €510 to fix it.Apple I even own your stock and everything you sell, including the stupid iPhone Mini Cooper and the helicopter.I am in Europe. How do I call you on a 1800 number? Why aren't you like every other company and have a bunch of Philipinos manning a online help system.And what is ACTUALLY going on with these machine because I know for damn sure this thing was NOT TOUCHED. This is a defect not an accidental damage.Disgusted with Apple Customer Service and recent product releases.Unhappy and loyal Apple customer."
cie_B	iPhone 4 and 4s guy	2016-08-09T22:00:00Z	2	Apple used to out proform all others by making well thought out products that were not released every year with little real improvement but like so many other crapy computer/mobile producers have gone for the cheap buck of bells and whistles that are gimmicks at best. After the iPhone4 and 4s Apple seams to just wants the customer to buy a $600+ phone every year, what happens to the Job's days where products were given quality time to develop, test, make and put to production when it was completed with the idea of taking 3-5years in between products to make a product worth buying and using for extended lengths of time. Software updates in te past few years has now render older product useless or functions crash when in use or won't even load up, tactics to push these older not so trendy folks into having to buy the new or last years model just to have a working product. iPhone 4s is my last Apple product I'll be buying and switching to companies that will build a quality items with out all the shady personal info gathering/selling and subpar product quality!Time to plant a new seed Apple and grow your client base back up again, restore your customers faith back in quality not quantity!

That is ok, customer service at Apple is always great. The issue started after leaving the store, first I got a call saying that the internal HD was the problem, they would replace it, BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE BACK THE OLD HD, why?????? Well, ok, as long as you fix it. Got another call after a week saying that actually it is not the internal HD, it is the logic board(mother board), I asked, are you sure??Of course, we got this, we are going to replace the Logic board and the Mac mini will be perfect again. $320.00 to have it fixed, ok, if that is going to fix the problem, why not. Come to the store to pick up my Mac mini after close to 3 weeks, and I find out that my ram was removed and that was the problem. WHATTTTTTT?????I was told 2 different problems prior to my arrival at the store and the problem was something else????I was robbed, I mean, charged $320 to fix a logic board and the problem was the ram. Super disappointed with the lack of communication and service done without consent from the customer. if I knew that I would have to replace every part in the computer, I would have bought a new one. Apple that really looked like a scam. Keeping the internal HD, replacing Mother board and none is the problem?????**** UPDATE *** PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVED AND THEY DO NOT KNOW THE REASON, REFUNDED THE MONEY AND KEEP YOUR COMPUTER AND GOOD LUCK. APPLE IS WASTE OF TIME AND THE MANAGER BRYAN IS THERE JUST TO HANDLE HIS BUSINESS CARS AND DISAPPEAR. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE FROM THE GET GO. NOT KNOWING THE PROBLEM, FIX STUFF WITHOUT ASKING, 3 DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THE PROBLEM AND NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM AT THE END.

cie_B	Marc Deheese	2016-07-28T22:00:00Z	4	Apple is a great company, with great tech, however the customer service I received at the Brussels Apple Store and technical support over the phone is probably not even what you would expect in a McDonald. Made appointment and got to the Apple store in Brussels for an iPhone repair.  So many customers complaining that Apple Genius is busy with 4 or 5 customers > lousy problem analysis , lousy service. You don't need to be an expert to understand that this Apple Genius is not qualified/trained for the job. Manager Ilya is a shame, only wants to get rid of customers and pretend problems are fixed. There is a huge gap between product quality and customer service quality. I don(t know if serious management is aware how bad customer service is, but if Apple wants to stay at the top, it will need to work very very hard on customer service, especially at the Apple Store Brussels.
cie_B	KLO	2016-07-27T22:00:00Z	1	I am the former happy owner of an iPad 4th generation, bought in jan. 2013. One week ago Apple brought out the software update IOS 9.3.3. Trusting their advise, I downloaded and tried to install the update, after which my iPad was impossible to reactivate. I searched the internet and found lots of advise: restore using iTunes, try another lightning/usb cable, - try another Mac. I even tried an older MacBook Pro, which wasn’t updated to the latest version of El Capitain (we keep it as a secure backup in case new Apple-updates downs the network, the necessity learned from rather expensive bought experience).After everything advised was tried and lost, I rang Apple support Denmark. They asked me to go through the same steps once more (If you don’t, we unfortunately are not able to help you any further). Ending up with the same ‘unexpected error’ they told me to go to the local Humac store and ask for service. The Humac staff told me, that sending it in for service would cost an x-amount of money and probably wasn’t worth it, but I could pay close to DKK 4000 and get the same iPad-version back in a completely new state. So I rang back Apple support DK, asking if they would either promise me free service or a price reduction buying a new iPad. Spending another 57 min’s, having to go through the same steps (If you don’t, we unfortunately are not able to help you any further), again ending up with the same ‘unexpected error’, I was told once more, that my iPad needed service and I should take it to the local Humac store. I went through the arguments of having bought an iPad for close to DKK 8.000 jan 2013, I’d even bought the Apple Care Protection Plan with it – and after this latest update, it was impossible to use. The lady of Apple support DK told me, that it probably was a hardware fault and no responsibility of Apple, and therefor they were not able to offer me any help, reimbursement or whatever in the matter. I asked to talk to a supervisor and was later called back from Ireland a very kind and understanding man, who unfortunately also was not able to offer me any help at all, besides taking my iPad to service and paying for it.The fault or ‘unexpected error’ had nothing to do with the update, but was probably a hardware problem, that might have been there from the very beginning, however, surfacing now with this latest update. He understood my problem, but unfortunately – since it was not the fault of the update or Apple – he was unable to help.He did however agree to the fact, that Apple produced the iPad in the first place, and that Apple also brought out the update, that ruined it or ‘caused the fault to surface’. He also reminded me, that when I downloaded the update, I had agreed, that Apple was not responsible for any problems occurring in its aftermath. That of course is true. I believe, I once read an article stating, that if you actually read all the conditions of downloads, transactions etc, you would have to spend an equal of 78 days a year reading the small print.I know, that I have no legal grounds of my claim, but never the less: 10 days ago I had a perfectly working iPad at the age of 3.6 years. Now I have spent at least two hours at the phone, 1/2 hour upgrading and several more trying to fix the problem, I have gone to the local store etc.And I am so angry. In my view Apple either produced an inferior product or ruined it by an destructive update. Either way: Apple is not paying – they leave it all to me.That is rotten – and I do live in Denmark, so I know the smell.
cie_B	Kenneth	2016-07-25T22:00:00Z	1	When my I Pad dropped to low energy and was recharged. Apple required my password. The passwords I had for it didn't work. So after several try's I was locked out for security reasons. Whose security? Mine. This is like a landlord changing locks on your apartment believing someone might enter and take my stuff. When I contacted the Apple Store all they could do to reboot the IPad would have resulted in deleting everything I had on it. I wrote to Tim Cook. No response. I send a second letter asking when I would get a reply to my request to unlock my IPad or retrieve my photos. No reply. Apple has gone too far in playing the security card for users.
cie_B	Haval Jelal	2016-07-23T22:00:00Z	1	Is it me or others feels the same that apple after care is very poor and all they try is to sale you a product then if it's faulty they don't take responsibility. Their guarantee is a shamble for expensive product they are selling. It's one year only!!! Although they advertise for 2years and depending on who deals with your case, they are saying legally it's one year!!! I am fed up with their poor customer service and after many years of using several latest apple products refuse to buy anything else from them. I was about to buy couple of iphone7 plus and MacBook Pro but I will keep my old product or looking for others like Samsung or google pixel. Surprisingly they do not have complaint department and if you have any issues then you should write to their office in Ireland which cost you postage fee, and apple company not registered with ombudsman or trading standards organisation!!! I will give apple zero star after 10 years based on poor customer care
cie_B	Sachin	2016-07-20T22:00:00Z	1	I used to love Apple stuff, and when it works, their products are still good. But I've had enough of their customer service. They're happy to charge premium prices but give the kind of service I'd expect from McDonalds.My iPhone 6 plus (which gets normal-moderate use, no games or heavy stuff) started developing battery problems just over a year after purchase. The battery would only last 5 hours or so and would drop suddenly e.g. from 70% to 30% in seconds. The genius bar told me that it was probably a known software fault that would be fixed in the next update, and if that didn't work, they told me to set up my phone as a new account to make sure it wasn't a software issue (thanks! years worth of apps and data lost - a fair solution?)So I did all that - same issue. I came and they told me that it was normal that my battery was dropping fast -eg 30% to 0% instantly, because of my phone's age (under 2 years!). Their diagnostics tool showed the battery at 86% of new capacity. Yet they believe it was normal behaviour for a battery to have large sudden drops, so I had to pay for a new battery!I requested that under UK consumer law they replace the battery for free, but they said no, that it only applies if the fault is made known to them within 6 months of purchase. That's not what the law says - the burden of proof shifts to the consumer, but I would have thought demonstrating the issues I was having are proof enough. Just feel ripped off. A phone this expensive should last 2 years of normal use without extreme battery issues. It clearly seems like a faulty battery to me. Thanks for nothing Apple.

As it is a screen replacement it costs 79.00 plus VAT =106.44 GBP. Apple support take £107.33 plus £1.00 GBP ? Get email notification phone is fixed and shipped back to me, no tracking ref or courier details. 2 days pass I contact Apple support to chase up where my phone is,, they can’t tell me They can’t even tell me what courier was used Disgraceful service from a so called top company.3 questions to answer here Apple,* Where is my iPhone??* Why was I charged more than your website price for this repair?* When are you going to actually have proper product support

What I recieved was a phone that overheated to the point of burning my leg through my pants, they swapped it for a factory replacement (refurbished) which I also had heat problems and screen issues with, again swapping for refurbished now my sound doesn't work and they will fix the sound but that's as far as Apple warranty will go even though I payed for Apple care. What a joke.

They told me it was no warranty because there was a little scratch on the screen. When i got it back my screen was BROKEN. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE WHEN I RETURNED IT! I also have pictures of the issue before i sent it to Apple for repair. Customer support is telling me a bull**** excuse that they cant open pictures and that they cant help me. Must me by own fault.NEVER EVER BUY SOMETHING FROM APPLE! ITS TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND EFFORD.

My MacBook is looking like hell its completely messed up the Apple Employee Techs didn't put it back together correctly my Sleep/Wake notification light is completely off centered my (Express Slot) is Jammed not working won't allow me to put my card into it... I'm done with this nightmare I just want to get rid of this computer and go back to my retina. Too many issues and problems. Going to get the computer fixed and sell it for a Retina. ... Not only was I denied a (CRU) but Alison King also told Apple that they are not to service this computer anymore due to Apple spending to much money on trying to fix a product that doesn't seem to be fixable and neither wanting to replace it as well or offering me a justify able solution. I called the store that did my repair. Not only were they rude about it but they denied me and told me that it was my fault cause I didn't ask the correct person on what the warranty status was when I clearly asked the person checking my computer into repair what will the warranty entail when it comes back I was given a document that clearly says that I will have a 90 day warranty with my computer when finished with its repair Now they are saying they don't want to honor that time period that I am basically SOL I have contacted Apple Customer Executive Relations about this matter and we shall see what they have to say later on today I was told i would be getting a call in my opinion I think it's people like (SR Customer Relations) Alison King that ruin things for everyone and gives Apple a bad name. I think all Apple should do is Fix/Repair the Computer they broke from the beginning.... If Apple reads this and wants to make things rite here's my email support @maxintoshenterprise.c o m
cie_B	Jackie	2016-06-01T22:00:00Z	1	I had an Apple Watch for Christmas which I wear maximum 4 days per week as don't wear to work It is the rose gold version which last week I noticed the paint rubbing off around the bezel so made an appointment at bath Apple Store only to be told it's wale at and tear (what after 6 months ) and they will do nothing so I'm wondering what this watch will look like after one year . I think when paying £300 for a watch that surely it should look cosmetically good after 6 months and that paint should not be peeling within this time as had I know I would never have paid that amount for something I could wear occasionally to keep it looking good . I have baby Apple products within my household and am really disappointed with this item I have lost all faith in Apple and would never recommend there watches to anybody especially if you are considering wearing it daily
cie_B	Jean	2016-05-28T22:00:00Z	1	I just ask to repair my beat studio dre wireless cushion earpad which was leaving so due to bad quality product. the woman i talked with explained me that it was not a problem at all to fix it, blablabla with a discour already prepared of course and that i will receive a box to send it back and will receive it 10days after in normal conditions....This f****** joke just did not explained the cost of it, i received an email charging me $299 to have the cushion of my beat repair (Cost $30 to do it by yourself). Your service is a joke, nobody would make repair a simple cushion for $300 ! that ridiculous, like your price, like your companyI DO NOT RECOMMEND to anybody to buy anything from you... BIG SCAM

She assured me from the beginning that she would resolve the problem and she did resolve it quickly and completely. She took the time to listen to my comments in full and followed up with appropriate action. Thank you so much for caring for me as a person and for solving my technical issue. I am so impressed with the quality of her customer care. FIVE STARS. :)
cie_B	Shireen Ridgway	2016-05-18T22:00:00Z	2	"I made a special trip to Westfield London for the Apple Store to buy an iPad Pro. As I enter an unsmiling woman in the apple green T asks what I want (verbatim) I said I wanted to buy an iPad Pro, to which she responds ""we're offline but you will be able to pay"". How odd, I'm then told to wait for a service person so I wait and wait. I then speak to the store ""leader"" who finds someone to help me. I say I want to trade in my apple mini, she says do you have ID, I reply only bank cards. She says well you can't trade in your mini. How am I to know that I am to bring in ID. So credit card and Apple ID with all my devices listed is not enough. She then calls another girl to reiterate what she has said like I'm a 12 yr old child. No chat, no negotiation. They treat anyone older than 40 like they're aliens who don't speak English."
cie_B	Zein Tarek Alwer	2016-05-18T22:00:00Z	1	"Extremely RUDE customer service in Apple Reading (oracle) UK.  my brother has a Mac book pro that had the same technical problem that I had with my old Mac book pro (which is from the moment of purchase it made clicking noise and then after about 5 months of using it, It suddenly turned off and stopped working) Took an appointment with Apple and they said they'll need to change the hard disc which will take about 15 minutes, I agreed and waited. While I was waiting I thought of paying extra and changing the Mac book pro with a the newer ""Mac book"" since the last time I came (when this problem happened with my laptop) the genius who was helping me advised me to get a new laptop rather than fix it since he said this is an old laptop that we don't make anymore, and if it clicks from the start, it might always have such problems (and I did pay extra and get  a Macbook with Retina display) So after the genius came back I asked if I can do that, he said ""nope"" I asked why not and he said ""we don't do that"". I should have gotten the hint that he was being rude by giving such short answers, but I didn't and explained to him how they did it with my old laptop. He seemed like he wasn't even hearing what I'm saying (felt like he thought I was lying when I said I did it before) and when I finished explaining he said ""no. we don't do that if you like I'll get you someone else to talk to"" and then looked at his watch like he doesn't have time to talkI said yes that would be great thank you No you're welcome no nothing , he just left and after 10 minutes he came back and a manager came with him. I said Hello, how are you .... do i need to explain what I'm asking or do you know? He answered ""I already know and it's not happening"" (In the rudest way EVER) and the genius staff beside him starting smiling and raising his eyebrows (like a 5 year old) and both of them had extremly rude body language. I was in shock.  I had the recipts opened on a laptop to show him that i did get the old one and then paid extra and got the new one, so I told him (the manager) ""but why not, that's what happened last time and I was able to change here are the recipts"" He said ""maybe you got lucky, i wasn't there then now I'm saying no"" (I called apple service they were very shocked of such claim and said there's nothing based on luck, they have the same procedures that all Apple stores follow) After he said no, I said ""but listen let me show you the recipts"" (because I felt he didn't believe that it happened) He answered in the most impolite way EVER ""don't tell me to listen I'm listening and even if you show me the recipts nothing's changing"" At this point I had no words, He was Extremely RUDE and him and the genius were standing in fort of me and looked so angry I even felt a bit threatened. I told him in a calm tone ""that is very disrespectful, I'm not talking to someone that disrespectful please go"" he said ""okay"" and I told the genius to get me someone else to talk they both answered ""he's the manager haha"" ""there's no one else to talk to I'm the manager haha"" I didn't move from my seat since I was in tears I'm not used to anyone talking this way with me and felt really threatened that I froze ( I also still needed to put the Laptop in my bag also I wanted to get there names so I can complain to Apple).The genius guy came back and told me ""I'm going to get you someone else to talk to is that ok?"" I guess at that point they discovered that what they did was wrong I agreed a new manager came (remember at first they said there's no one else to talk to..)  The new manager was polite apologised on behalf of the other one and tried to find a valid reason for why they won't change the laptop but couldn't (I guess he just didn't want to change the laptops because the other 2 said no and now if he agreed they would look like they made a mistake) anyway, I thanked him for trying to find a valid reason but that it doesn't make sense and told him to give me there names. Here are there names Paul (the genius. He's short, black hair and wears glasses) Alex W (the rudest manager and person I've ever met in my life) And Tom Ryan (the other manager who tried to help at the end) I'm a student living alone in Reading, I have no family to protect me here and I avoid problems at all costs. I did not even imagine Apple customer service to get to such a low level to the point that I felt threatened by how they talking, stood, looked and behaved  this was the worst Apple experience in my life, they ruined my whole day and I could sleep at night just remembering what happened. Also not only did I feel threatened I also felt they were (at least the first genius ""Paul"") racist since I'm an Arab and he knew that (the apple laptop was from purchased from Dubai and my English shows I'm not British) and I know he was looking down on me for being an Arab (which is disgusting of him). Hope you take such complaints seriously, since Apple as a brand will defiantly lose a lot of its customer services become this bad (and I checked the facebook reviews for the Apple Store in Reading and most of the reviews had 1 star this should indicate something to you)."
cie_B	Rajendra Pai	2016-05-16T22:00:00Z	1	Have had an iPhone 5s which was originally bought in the US and had a few display problems...Went to the Apple Store in Reading, UK and was made to wait for 45 mins inspite of having an appointment.Also when I was attended, I was told that the issue can be fixed for free but only if I was in the US, and I can trade in the phone for £ 125 to buy another new iPhone or spend £ 99.00 to repair the display problem...Whatever happened to world wide support ? Apple has an extremely pathetic after sales service and I will think 10 times before buying an expensive rip-off iPhone or any apple product in future...
cie_B	Harrison Street	2016-05-11T22:00:00Z	2	My iPhone Plus freezes constantly. I have to lock the phone then unlock the phone for the screen to start working with my finger! I did the new update and it still does the freezing every few minutes. This is unexceptable, especially an iPhone Plus! My sister, mother, father, and friends all have the same freezing of touch control with their iPhone 6. I'm about to move to droid.

cie_B	A disgusted Apple Customer	2016-05-06T22:00:00Z	1	I've just got off the phone following approx 10 phone calls over a 4 week period with Apple customer care; this was following 4-5 sessions on their chat room.  In total several frustrating hours over a 4 week period.  In spite of escelation the issue on 3-4 different occasions to 'senior' managers, each one promising to resolve the problem; NOT 1 response, phone call, e-mail or even old fashioned letter.Their system is a nightmare (when it doesn't crash); in spite of providing all of your phone and contact details, each time you dial in; you have to recount the issue from scratch all over again...In summary, Apple couldn't care less about their customers, they hope that you will go away and get tired of contacting them.  I regret to say that my family are owners of srveral, i-phones, i-pads, laptops, beats ear phones - all over priced (for the shocking customer service which you receive subsequently!!!).  Congrats Apple, for the most in-effecient, pathetic customer service experience that I've had in my entire life..... never again will I be stupid enough to purchase an Apple product.

Apple need to train their staff and be honest with their loyal customers, I will not but from Apple because they are misleading their customer in a wrong way....
cie_B	Jørgen	2016-04-22T22:00:00Z	1	I get the impression that Apple's help desk consist of teenagers who are incredible stupid and immature. When I ask for simple help, they tried to help me for 5'th time without any result. They know it very well, that they are completely incompetent. I decided ( and I stand by my word ) I'm not going to ever buy another apple product anymore.I unfortunately have an Ipad and Iphones, but this is it. It got to stop with Apple. Other companies offers better service than Apple.

cie_B	Bobby Lew	2016-03-31T22:00:00Z	5	Apple is upfront on their terms and they are usually somewhat reasonable terms as well. They will honor their deficits according to those upfront terms so in that way they are reputable. Their products have rarely failed on me though they are way overpriced. You can certainly purchase from Apple and feel safe after you've decided it's worth the large investment and the limits of either terms or features described are somewhat worth it; I still buy from them even though I usually feel I am over paying.
cie_B	Brooke Beitel	2016-03-31T22:00:00Z	5	My Apple ID has been locked for awhile now, and i didn't really need to unlock it till now. when i contacted Apple, they put me in touch with a super nice lady named Vikki! She was super understanding and very patient. together we worked through my email problems and y security questions and we got  so close to fixing it until she had to go due to a tornado touching ground where she was. So I hope she okay, and that somehow she sees this. Thank you Vikki! you were such an awesome lady and you were very good support. I managed to get it the last stretch on my own, but i couldn't have done it without her!!
cie_B	Ian	2016-03-29T22:00:00Z	1	Shockingly bad service from Apple. Two weeks ago I took my iphone 6 to the local authorized reseller for a screen repair. A week ago I was told that  between Apple and their shipping agent the phone had gone missing. After a further three days the local guy said off the record that I would be best calling Apple Care as they were getting nowhere. The latest is Apple are 'investigating' but it maybe two weeks before I hear back. Obviously no Sherlock Holmes in the investigation team.All I want is my phone back, not a lot of of nicely spoken Apple Care reps saying it is under investigation. I am sure that no one is looking in a warehouse, they are probably waiting to see if 'the system' spits out the phone. All the while I am left phone less. From the biggest corporation in the world rubbish service, the cracks in the Apple empire are starting to show
cie_B	Rob	2016-03-28T22:00:00Z	1	"I have sent back my iPhone models about 10 times every time I have a problem! It gets sent back to the Netherlands where apparently they repair it in which they claim within 7 days..each time I have had to wait about 4 weeks until I get my iPhone back. There customer service over the phone is aload of BS, they lie about the repair status and brush you off with silly things saying ""oh it will be done within 2 days"" blah blah blah. They are ment to be one of the TOP companies in the world..they take your money and that's it..aftercare service is down the drain. Really disappointed with Apple after I spent thousands of pounds on there products and they don't deliver!"

cie_B	Nicholas Hansen	2016-03-23T23:00:00Z	2	I had my iPhone for repair four times before it was replaced. In total, I was without the device for more than three months. And it is annoying, especially when having in mind that a device lasts for less than two years. Pls take responsibility, Apple.
cie_B	ccyoung	2016-03-23T23:00:00Z	1	I went into the online Apple Store UK on Tuesday 22nd of March to buy a replacement iPad. My wife's had her iPad 2 for 5 years and has developed charging issues and as I'm due to go on a business trip, I wanted her to have a new reliable machine to FaceTime or Skype on, especially as I have young kids. I looked at the iPad Air 2 64gb and noticed that they listed 6 refurbished models available for delivery tomorrow, bonus being £70 cheaper. Result?I took Wednesday off to accept delivery and set it up but when it looked like it wasn't coming, I phoned Apple. Really sorry but there's a stock available issue, but there wasn't when I ordered and paid for it. Will it be delivered Thursday? We'll get it sorted.An email arrived on Wednesday 23rd @ 17:25, expect delivery on the 30th. This was after I agreed with my boss to take another morning off to take receipt of the iPad. This is 7 days after the initial date promised date when you buy the thing. I doubt I'll still be home in 7 days. Buying this now looks like a waste of time.This isn't the first time this has happened to me either, recently I have bought an iPad mini for my daughter, I think this was 4 days late. Then I bought another mini for my mother-in-law, I think this was 5 days late. This is not an isolated issue.Been on the phone again today & the lady I spoke to was very helpful however the result is that it won't be available till the 30th. When I pointed out this was a breach of contract, why accept payments for products you don't have, just send me out a new one. She went to talk to (I think) 2 managers who said Apple is not at fault, delivery will be the 30th & if that's not good enough, cancel the order and buy another one. Even if I thought this acceptable, what guarantee do I have that this one would turn up this side of never? Will I end up with the same limp wristed excuse? Probably. So unfortunately because I don't want to waste anymore time phoning or do a 70 mile round trip to the nearest Apple Store, I am effectively, humped!I was looking at an iMac Mini for my son who will be starting high school after the summer, a replacement tablet for son number 2 at Christmas & probably a new mini for child number 4 as she doesn't have a tablet and is nipping my ear about Minecraft. However if Apple can't even manage to sell & deliver properly, what chance do I have if there are any product issues?This experience is pushing me toward Samgsung because none of these devices are cheap and I now don't have much confidence in Apple, nor do I want to waste more time dicking about on the phone when clearly floor managers don't appear to give a toss.
cie_B	Karina Rosa	2016-03-18T23:00:00Z	1	Apple has gotten lazy. I only ever buy Apple products, but this year one by one each has had an issue. The in store service has been disgraceful, and I will never buy another Apple product again.Complete fail from what was once a great company.
cie_B	Bob	2016-03-17T23:00:00Z	2	March 2012 purchased top-of-line i-Mac desktop, nearly $3000.  March 2016 video card burned out (computer has always run really hot, and Apple says they will fix this, but not replace the video card unless I pay for it).  Turned it in for repair 03-09, and was told it wold be ready no later than 03-13.  It's now 03-18, and they ware awaiting arrival of the cable to fix the overheating problem, and have no idea when it will arrive, hence can't tell me when I can get the computer back.  It used to be that I could go buy a video card and replace it myself, but not with Apple's overpriced tech.  Now, I have to spend more for a new video card than the computer is presently worth, to get it back, and it apparently takes 9 plus days to get it done.  Hey Apple, I've got an idea, why don't you use some of that 200 BILLION dollars in accumulated profits you've amassed at your customer's expense to maintain an inventory of spare parts so you can fix your products in a more timely manner!!!I originally bought Apple products because they were well designed, easy to use, somewhat intuitive, and were less prone to viruses/malware than the alternative.  But, lately, Apple products seem needlessly overloaded with too many bells and whistles that I suspect 99 % of their customers don't really use, and they aren't nearly as intuitive as they once were.  And, they have become seriously expensive.  I wouldn't mind the expense so much if they still delivered top line customer service, but this experience is causing me to consider returning to PC's.  You've lost a fan Apple, Steve Jobs must be turning over in his grave.  I suspect service wouldn't ever have been allowed to become this substandard if he were still running the company.
cie_B	Bianka Juhász	2016-03-14T23:00:00Z	1	"My few-months-old iPhone went just all black - production hardware failure - while I am on a half a year trip far away from home (Denmark), somewhere in Australia.In 2 days, manage to arrive to my savior - I though-, to an Apple store in Melbourne. They constant that it's their production fault, the phone cannot be fixed, need to be replaced with a new/refurbished phone.BUT! Here comes THE APPLE RULE: ""Phone bought in Europe can only be replaced with a phone from Europe."" Meaning, although they have the phone ready in the store here in Melbourne, they have to order one from Europe, which will take 3 WEEKS to arrive.What can Ms. Loyal Apple customer do? LIVE AND TRAVEL IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY ALONE WITHOUT PHONE WHILE DOES NOT KNOW ANYONE ON THE WHOLE CONTINENT - no google map, no watch, no calling home to the family and friends.Other option? I can buy a new phone from the store such as everyone else without any discount and throw away my few-months-old one. Thank you, Apple! Hilarious!One thing for sure, even if I had all my gadgets from Apple, NO MORE. Sadly, I will never buy anything from Apple from now on, if this is the help and service if the customer needs it."

Typically I would use rechargeable batteries but on one occasion I used 'cheap' supermarket batteries which then leaked. I got the batteries out but the battery compartment was a bit of a mess and the keyboard stopped working. I took it to my local Apple store and explained what had happened. They checked it over and then decided to give me a brand new keyboard on the spot! No wonder I'm a happy customer, and have gone on to purchase a great many Apple products as well as persuading friends and family to buy them.
cie_B	Lewis Ludwig	2016-02-19T23:00:00Z	1	Went to the Naperville store with a problem with my phone.  Could not change my voice mail greeting.  After a half an hour they could not fix it.  Then I asked them to try and restore some photos to my phone that had been lost.  Not only could they not do that either, but in the process, they wiped out all the pictures that were already on my phone.  I was literally better off before I set foot in the store!  Worst customer service I have ever had in my life!
cie_B	Nick	2016-02-15T23:00:00Z	1	After many many hours of very polite help and a replacement phone, Apple still can't make my phone receive iMessages. They tell me to go away and do things - none of which work. I go back and repeat same thing. Why should I waste my time fixing something that I have paid for and which does not work properly? Don't buy an iPhone!
cie_B	Gareth Davies	2016-02-13T23:00:00Z	5	Whether or not Applecare+ is worth it (it's an insurance product) I wanted to buy it for an iPhone 6s. I had misunderstood the end date of the 60 day purchase limit (you have to buy it within 60 days of purchase of the device). There's some ambiguity around this I think - does the day of order or the day of delivery count as day 1?Anyway, I was one day out according to Apple's calculations but the problem was solved very easily - without me asking - and the purchase was allowed.Not all companies are this flexible with ambiguous deadlines so credit where credit is due.I know this is feedback about sales rather than feedback about customer service when a device breaks but, still, it's worth positive feedback given how effortless and easy for me the transaction was. The customer service and Applecare adviser were also very professional in their communication - unusually so by the standards of many companies.

cie_B	Mall	2016-01-10T23:00:00Z	1	Extremely poor customer service.Repeatedly lied to about products, waiting times, repair and replacement. Staff untrained in the product line and unable to deal effectively with defective products they are selling. Macbook pro under a year old returned to shop and was told the wait might be an hour. In the end had to wait 5 hours to see a 'genius' and then a further hour of 'tests'.Finally was told the macbook had a faulty GPU and would have to go in for replacement board. Four days later when the macbook was returned had to wait again to see anyone before I finally got working macbook back. Used it at home for twenty minutes and then fault returned. Phoned the store and was assured that they would issue a brand new replacement as they had already attempted the repair and failed. Of course this was a lie. again more waiting, more 'tests' - was told that the new board they had inserted was itself faulty.
cie_B	Ryan Huang	2016-01-07T23:00:00Z	1	Apple only cares about a customer is when you are in their store, and once they made money off of you, they don't care about you a bit. Apple doesn't even have the courtesy to at least contact the customer to show that it at least still cares after my previous complaint. I was a PC user for a very long time and recently decided to switch to a Mac thinking it may be better quality. What a mistake! First month of having the unit, the external HDD kept disconnecting and the tech support people blames it on my VMware Fusion software. I guess it's easy to just pin everything on the customer. I didn't even have the software running most of the time and yet the external HDD would just drop off. A few weeks later, I changed my Apple ID Password and this was my biggest nightmare -- I had to type in my password 10 times each time I open iCloud, email, notes, contacts....etc. It seems like the keychain utility is corrupted after resetting my password and somehow ALL my saved passwords and certificates are gone! This is not the end of it. I had a VPN subscription software and my license had 1050 days left. After the keychain became corrupted, the system somehow removed the license and now my software wouldn't work no more! Today, I tried to log into my system and the CAP lock lights were OFF but yet it seems like the CAPs are still really on. My wife tried our password five times and almost got ourselves locked out of the system because of this. Our family has been loyal iPhone users for a long time and we sincerely believed the Mac would be a good product but we were REALLY wrong. In addition, we just found out that Apple's App store software are often more expensive than those of Google play. After trying to inquire about this issue to Apple, no one bothered to listen and simply hang up on me. We will be dropping ALL Apple products for good. To ALL Apple employees -- you think you work for Apple and you think you are superior? I hope you all get laid off in the next recession!

cie_B	Mr Bruce Williams	2015-12-14T23:00:00Z	1	"Macbook Pro is 9 months old and cannot find its hard drive. Spent 2 hours on Chat function with Apple Rep to solve the problem. After 2 hours the issue became worse - from not booting up correctly, to not being able to find its hard drive as mentioned. Not able to see an ""Apple Genius"" for over a week - no idea why I need an appointment to get my product fixed. I should be able to drop off my Mac off with the retail store to be fixed and collect when it is ready, like any normal Customer Service model would allow. For a laptop which cost in excess of £1600 I am more than appalled. I used to be such an advocate of Apple. I have a Performa desktop from 1993 which still works perfectly."
cie_B	Paul G	2015-12-12T23:00:00Z	2	I won't go into the blow by blow account of what I'm not happy about, but in summary got a solution but terrible customer service to get there:- Only available reservation for genius was 1 week after I was in there!- Nearly as many staff in the store as customers, yet many chatting amongst themselves while customers queue- After a week of waiting for genius bar appointment, had to wait a further 40 minutes in-store as they were running late- Good and bad - apple guy didn't bother checking my problem and simply said my iPad was still under warranty so easiest to get a new one- Whilst filling in the details, he then backtracked when he decided my iPad wasn't registered to my apple ID - and in quite an accusing tone, was about to back out of everything. Without saying anything, he then realised he'd typed the wrong serial number into the system and retyped everything without a word to me and without apologising for his perviously accusing tone- Once everything was filled in, and he'd ask me to sign, only then did he inform me they don't have any stock of that model so can't make the swap there and then - now I have to wait another weekSuggestions for Apple Store Brent Cross to improve:- allow appointments more than a week out- run a reward scheme that asks customers for feedback on the individual staff members - it may make them WANT to give good customer service

cie_B	Laura Williams	2015-12-05T23:00:00Z	1	I waited three days for my order to be delivered. Every day Apple told me the courier had been to my house which was not the case. We were home and no sorry I missed you card left, I asked after a week of non delivery for the order to be cancelled. It is almost a week later again and I still have not had any refund and no item. They have not even actioned a return to sender with the couirer. Customer service is awful, the colleagues that operate chat are dismissive and do not listen to issues.  Apple just blame customers for their lack of service and refuse to help. I have been advised that I cannot have a refund until item is back with Apple but the courier will only send the item back under Apple instruction. I have not received an item and I should be able to cancel the order.
cie_B	Mike	2015-12-02T23:00:00Z	1	"Below is the reason I'm getting rid of my Macbook Pro, my iPad and my iPhone. This is the straw that broke the camel's back. Somebody ought teach the managers there that ""You can milk a cow a thousand time's but you can only skin it once"". From looking at the reviews on here, they've 'skinned' a fair few of their customers and they are now losing £1000's from another over £126. I'm glad their share prices are dropping.Also, this Travis character below, cut me off even though he could see I was still typing. Me: HelloMe: I got disconnected during my last chatAthena: Hello Mike. Im sorry you were disconnected. I see that you are chatting with me because you have a cracked screen, is that right ?Me: Yes that's rightMe: I'm extremely disappointedAthena: I can totally understand why this would be an issue for you. I have cracked a few screens before. I’ll be more than happy to help you resolve this today.Me: It's funny because I never once cracked my HTC OneMe: and I put the iPhone in a case that sat proud of the screen to stop this happeningMe: The case is fine as well, remarkablyMe: Apparently they can withstand a 2ft fall far better than the phonesAthena: Yes that is because some phone are not made from actual glass. The iPhone screen is made from real glass, so it is more fragile.Me: I'm sorry if I sound arsey. But I'm only 2 months into a 24 month contract and this is already a nuisanceAthena: I can see why you would feel that way. Did you purchase the insurance plan through your carrier ?Me: Also, the HTC was a glass displayMe: No I didn'tAthena: Okay. Screen replacement for your model iPhone is £ 126.44.Me: That's disgustingAthena: The price is disgusting ?Me: Yes absolutelyMe: You clearly use cheap glass. It isn't sapphire or gorilla glass like on android phonesMe: There is no need for it to be that expensiveMe: I expect the reason you didn't upgrade the glass on it this year is because replacing them is such a cash cow for youMe: £126 a popMe: Over 200 million iPhone usersMe: I'd be interested to know what your net global profit is off the back of these repairsMe: The fact that mine broke after only 2 months doesn't fill me with hope for the future thoughAthena: I can see why you would feel that. Please allow me a few minutes to consult a senior advisor for you.Athena: Thank your for being patient Mike. I have a senior advisor by the name of Travis. That will be speaking with you from here. Is it ok if I transfer you ?Me:Yes, that's fine. Thank youAthena: Your welcome. Thank you for chatting with me.Travis: Thanks for contacting AppleCare chat support. My name is Travis. Please give me a moment to look over your information.Travis: Hi Mike, thanks for being so patient with Athena as she brought me up to speed today. I see here that you have cracked your screen and are upset about the service options as you feel this crack was not something that you had caused. Is that correct?Me: I wouldn't phrase it like that in a court of law, but essentially yes.Travis: Ok I see, thanks for confirming that for me. I have just read over the chat and thats what it had seemed like to me so I wanted to make sure.Me: It's the quality of the screen and the cost you charge to repair that I take great issue withTravis: Also I wanted to clarify that Athena was incorrect on a few details. Our iPhones actually use a newer versions of Gorilla Glass specially formulated through an ion-change process. Its one of the strongest glass screens on the market currently.Me: Although, you've read the chat so I won't bother repeating myselfTravis: Correct, I wont be asking you to repeat yourself.Me: Well if that is the case then I would 100% argue that my model does not have that displayTravis: At this time, based on what I see in the previous chat, this will have a cost if you would like to get this serviced.Me: I watched numerous drop test videos before buying itMe: How can I get my screen tested?Travis: You are welcome to bring this to an Apple Retail Store if you feel it was a defect or feel you were given an iPhone not made of the same materials.Travis: Would you like me to see if we have any open reservations anytime soon?Me: I would strongly contest that this does not have the glass you attest to. My HTC one, not in a case for 24 moths, survived far worse falls without so much as a scratchMe: Yes, please doTravis: What is your current postal code?Me: W1B 5NHTravis: If you wanted to visit the Regent Street Apple Retail Store, they have a reservations on December 10th in the morning.Me: And I would like this flagging on your system as an unresolved complaint. And I'd also like a note made that once my Macbook Pro, iPad and iPhone reach the end of their life spans, based solely on this one experience, I will never be using apple againMe: A week?Me: Is that a joke?Travis: The Covent Garden store has open reservations starting December 9th.Travis: No this is not a joke. They are quite busy and often times it takes a few days to a week to find an open reservation.Me: They clearly have a lot of broken cr*p to deal withMe: Book me in on the 10thTravis: Would you like to setup a reservation?Me: I would also like email confirmation that this is being registered as an unresolved complaint with the points I raised aboveTravis: Sure. Our earliest is 8:20 am and the latest is 10:20am. What time works for you?Me: 10:20 is fineTravis: That wont be possible Mike, we do not email confirmation of complaints however I will surely make a note of that here and forward it to the team that reviews these cases.Me: Then ask one of them to email me to confirm they have received itMe: I assume apple employees have email addresses?Me: Or do you charge extra for emails?Travis: The team that deals with complaints do not reach out to customers. This feedback is taken in and evaluated. If something was handling incorrect, we would change that for next time.Travis: At this time this would be your final answer and filing a complaint would not change that outcome.Travis: Did you have any other questions pertaining to the damage of this iPhone?Me: The team that deals with complaints don't reach out to customers?Travis: Correct.Me: Mind telling me how they resolve complaints?Me: Ignoring aggravated customers isn't the most solid business model in the worldTravis: Im empowered at a managerial level within Apple and am fully capable of ensuring that your case is handled appropriately. They will provide feedback and suggestions if something was handled incorrectly however they will not reach out to you.Travis: Did you have any further questions Mike?Me: LotsMe: Nothing pertinent to this thoughTravis: Ok. If you have any further questions relating to this issue, definitely feel free to reach out again. I will have this fully documented should you have any issues at the Apple Retail Store. Have a nice day ahead!"
cie_B	Farah Zubair	2015-11-27T23:00:00Z	1	I am fuming with anger whilst writing this message. It's been nearly 3 months since I ordered an Apple iPhone 6s Plus but later cancelled the order because I purchased one online. When I ordered the iPhone I made a payment through wire transfer but later I requested a refund. Till this date, even after contacting several times I still haven't received my £699.00 back. I want my money back, what sort of company is this who claims to be a prestigious one but acts worse than a third class company. I ordered the phone on 15th September & cancelled it on 3rd October. Since then I'm ringing twice or thrice every week just to get my money back. I now think I need to go through the legal process & I am also going to put this in Apple's review. I am very much disappointed as it is now getting serious. I won't let Apple eat my money but for sure they are a con company because they do not update me & every time I call they bombard me with apologies & promise to solve it but till date it's still not solved. I WANT MY MONEY BACK PLEASE. Come on get to work & refund me, you guys R a waste!!!!!!!!

cie_B	Lee	2015-11-09T23:00:00Z	4	I had a problem with my phone. I took it in and at first the service wasn't great. Once I escalated I have to admit it got a lot better. Very happy now, phone replaced and warantee extended.
cie_B	margit	2015-11-05T23:00:00Z	1	I am very disappointed. You have an I phone 4 S, which I use in my company, as a small office when I'm not home. Suddenly the screen freezes and I have to reboot the iPhone's to get it working again. When it starts up, the changed melody calls. Sometimes change the sound again by itself. When it rings, it's not always respond and I lose calls. It has also been incredibly slow. I have warranties and submitted it to repration. Got the message that it had passed all test and a bill of $ 43.00 With the message that the continued problem I could take it back, yes, and if it still bestos test I would get ydderligere a bill of $ 43.00. I daren't take it again, even though the problem is still there when I can not see that Your test would be different next time. I think it's very poor service and feel that could just as well say I am filled with lies. I had expected better service from Appel.

Firstly I have to engage with an automated system which I gave up with.  Then I got through to someone in Ireland who refused to put me through to the store until I told him what I wanted to talk to the store about.Apple, what has happened to you.......

cie_B	Christina Littleson	2015-10-27T23:00:00Z	1	My iphone 5 stopped working, so I made an appointment at the Glasgow, Buchanan Street store to see a 'genius' who was anything but. When I got to the store I spoke to a female worker, she told me to go speak to a male standing by the door and he would book me in with the genius bar. He told me to just hang about the store until someone came and got me. I waited absolutely ages. In that time lots of staff seemed to be hanging about doing nothing, a few times people came in that they obviously knew and they would go away and speak to them. I got bored waiting so went and asked one of them what was happening and he had no idea why I was told to just hang about. He then told me to go upstairs and speak to a young guy at the top of the stairs. He thought I'd only just arrived in the store as no one had let them know I was there, even though the guy I saw at the door said he had. I eventually was seen by a 'genius' he barely even looked at my phone. He looked up my details on the computer and said 'Oh, it's got a major fault and as it's a few weeks out of it's warranty it will cost £199 to repair' he then suggested I just purchase another new phone as 'In the long run that will be cheaper' I left the store and took my phone to a few smaller phone repair stores. They all looked properly at the phone and gave me quotes of between £24 an £36 for what they all said was a fairly minor fault. Let one of them fix it and working fine now. Apple are crooks.Also no charger ever works for more than a few months, not even ones purchased from the apple store.
cie_B	Srinivas	2015-10-20T22:00:00Z	1	Pre-ordered iPhone 6s and the main camera stopped working with in first week. Went to nearest store to get it fixed, nope they can't help because I bought the phone from Apple.com and they won't service my phone at local store. Spent at least 20 hours todate with customer support team and still struggling to return the phone and get refund. Every time I call them, even with case reference number, had to start the story from the beginning and after 30-45 minutes they simply disconnect the call or transfer to wrong department. Either they don't care about customer or they have not been trained properly.Wouldn't buy apple product again and even if I have to I won't buy it from online store.
cie_B	RJ	2015-10-19T22:00:00Z	5	What a joy it was to visit the Apple Store on 59th Street!  As a non-techie with copious reservations, I was pleased with the service that I received from salespeople Cristina Twitty and Brian Velez.  My visit started with Cristina, who is the consummate professional.  She was extremely patient with me.  My past experiences with laptops have been so dire that I was left skeptical about spyware and malware and the whole internet experience.  I had many questions, and although she answered all of them, she didn't mind, and even encouraged, my asking all the questions that I needed to before investing in my purchase.   She answered all of my questions until she was absolutely sure that I understood all the points.  She went beyond the call of duty by going to different Apple experts to explain certain points to me to ascertain that I understood what my purchase of a MacBook Air entailed.  My concern was mostly about malicious spyware and malware, and she asked several experts to explain everything to me until she felt that I was comfortable with my imminent purchase.  I left the store assured that I made the best purchase.  Cristina's selling savvy was stellar!  Then she made sure that Brian Velez introduced me to my MacBook Air.  Brian was a joy to learn from, and he was so patient with me.  His great disposition put me at ease, and he also answered all of my questions while teaching me how to navigate my new MacBook.  He was a delight!  Both salespeople were beautiful spirits that I had the pleasure of learning from.  I have  never had such a pleasant experience making a purchase.  I will definitely go back to the Apple Store for any technological purchases that I need, and that is a credit to two wonderful salespeople!  Thank you for a wonderful experience!
cie_B	Kristina	2015-10-18T22:00:00Z	1	Terrible service waiting on the holding line for 45 minutes being transferred to wrong department and then waited another 1,5hrs to deal with my issue.
cie_B	Kathleen Dupuis	2015-10-13T22:00:00Z	5	I am so impressed with the wonderful support I recieved from Apple when I called with a problem after an update. The support agent was not condescending, even though I'm not very up on the lingo and processes like iCloud. He was calm, supportive, and I really felt he understood my frustration. Thanks to his questions, we were able to resolve my problem with out a reset of my phone. This level of support is so reassuring! Thank you!!!
cie_B	Badlands	2015-10-06T22:00:00Z	1	Great products - until you have an issue with one of them and try to sort it out. After downloading a software update, my entire iTunes content disappeared. Not so worried about purchased items, as I can always redownload those - it's the CD's I have imported over about 10 years I'm more concerned with. Anyway, I schedule a call with Apple. They don't find a solution, but promise to call back after consulting a senior adviser. No call back. I schedule another call (a different guy rings me), and after 2 hours of conversation and him having access to my laptop so he can actually see what I'm on about, he comes to the conclusion it's a software issue and says he's going to speak with the software team and get in touch over the next few days. 3 weeks later, and nothing... I try the Apple live chat support instead - they can't help with the issue, so I ask if I can book a Genius bar appointment in store. No, apparently I can't, as they are fully booked. Fully booked for the next how many weeks?! I am given a link which apparently I can use to book a Genius appointment at another store, or to keep trying to see if any become available at my chosen store. I click on this link, and I try every single store within a 50 mile radius. The message is the same: Sorry, but we are unable to make your reservation. Please try again or choose another solution. So, every single store is fully booked for the foreseeable future? What other option am I supposed to choose? I have exhausted every single option. Apple seem to think that because they're a massive multi-national corporation, they can treat customers appallingly. Literally the worst service I've ever encountered.
cie_B	Tracy Mitchell	2015-10-01T22:00:00Z	1	Do not use the apple store buy from their products else where they need to use reputable delivery companies to deliver their products.
cie_B	Cassandra Walczyk	2015-09-29T22:00:00Z	2	"I am a brand new customer to Apple as of this past year. Apple was always something intriguing to me that I wanted to learn more about as I grew up with all Microsoft products. Within the past year I got a MacBook Pro, an Air 2, and have been contemplating the IPhone 6S. I had one rough patch when Apple Care would not repair the MacBook that my son literally sprinkled his sippy cup over when I had by far worse accidents repaired by Geek Squad at Best Buy with no issues. Long story short, we ended up working out a compromise, despite the surprise with their lesser coverage in comparison. When it came to Apple, I had superior expectations with everything do to so many positive reviews from products and customer support. Also, with the price point to what most would consider a premium quality product.Tonight really took the cake. I had an absolutely DISGRACEFUL experience with the closing manager at the South Windsor Connecticut store. Let me start with the fact that I have been working in retail for at least past decade of my life now and I know that more and more of large scale corporations are leaning towards online sales. This is out of ""convenience"" to the customer (or in my opinion a way of hiring less store employees across the board in a company), companies have set their sales up so that a customer can purchase an item for a quick pick up that very same day at a nearby location. Again, this is supposed to be a ""convenience"" to the customer.So, tonight I did just that and purchased a typical IPad Mini that most all Apple locations readily have on hand. On the order it said ""Pick up: Available Today"". It did also state that there would be a confirmation email when the order was ready to be picked up. I did not have time to wait as I only had the free time to pick it up before the store closed so I headed in that direction thinking logically as most would that how much time do they need to get a stock item on their shelf ""ready"". Heck, I don't mind waiting a few minutes for them to prepare things if need be.I headed in and they greeted me after a few moments and I told them that I was ready to pick up my item. They started to look it up, but couldn't find anything which made me concerned as I process credit and loans in my retail position all the time. So, I understand the speed in which transactions process electronically and had the expectation of Apple being an efficient company.The young lady who helped me, called Apple Online Customer Service to question it further. During the end of that call, so she proceeded to tell me that the order was placed on a 24 hour hold for fraud which was even more upsetting. I glanced at my email on my phone to see that the order had processed on my credit card . She then advised me to call Apple Online Store back to speak with verification (rather than connecting me herself to someone). I called them back myself to get a woman who told me that it takes 24 hours to process the sale and there was nothing they could do other than have me drive back tomorrow (which was a time that I was not available after already driving an hour round trip to/from that location), but that there was no holds or fraud notifications on the order. She suggested that I spoke to a verification specialist about the fraud and then transferred to me to a menu that kept asking me to punch in an extension which further frustrated me.I then asked the young lady in the store if I could speak with a manager who could help clear things up as I had come so far. So, this older man who was the manager that evening immediately confronted me after speaking with her. He aggressively asked if I had received the email that it was ready for pick up. I said no, but it said ready today and I did not have the time to wait before closing. He cut me off and argued that I was wrong for even bothering to come in for that item without any confirmation of it being ready. At the point I purchase that item, it is MINE. I should not have to be told when I can have it when I am a paying customer. That 24 hour hold is a CROCK if I ever did hear one. I sell orders for thousands of dollars in my retail position via online for immediate pick up in store. My order was a measly three hundred something dollars which any fraud department would have squared away in no time. I said maybe I should of bought it from Best Buy and they would let me pick it right up. He encouraged me to go ahead!! He continued to argue with why I was wrong (something that you should NEVER do in retail with your customer). He then just turned his back to me and walked off as I called my friend asking what I should do as I was extremely upset and on the verge of canceling it. If it wasn't for the fact that I am leaving the state before this weekend and this wasn't a gift for my friend who wanted this particular device badly, I surely would have!This has been one hell of a first year dealing with Apple and I am completely turned off."
cie_B	Mary Campbell	2015-09-28T22:00:00Z	1	Went to Fairview store twice today as I did not realize one had to use Genius Bar on computer to get service.  My MacPro zero key stopped working and I soon realized how often it is needed including in my case to bank as my client card contains a zero.  There is no Apple store near where I am currently located, went to Fairview store in Toronto; was told I needed an appointment; given one for height of rush hour at Don Mills and Sheppard, 6 p.m.; returned and went to Genius Bar and was told that I needed a new keyboard and repair would take up to 2 weeks.  The queue might shorten at some point but if I waited they might not have the keyboard (for a MacPro] and I would be bumped out of line.  I asked them how a car dealership could operate in such a fashion with people not being able to do without a car for two weeks and not stocking parts.  They told me there were space limitations but how much space does a keyboard top take!  In a car garage a loaner car would be offered.  If that were the case at Apple one might get hooked on substitution of an iPad.  However, obviously Apple expects you to buy another product as they would be the first to say that we could not conduct our lives for two weeks without a computer.  I was in fact thinking of an iPad as my laptop is relatively heavy but now I do not plan to purchase another Apple product.  The lady beside me at the Genius Bar was very frustrated as she uses Apple to conduct her own business and said that service has deteriorated terribly in the past two years.
cie_B	Geraldo V Vieira	2015-09-24T22:00:00Z	1	I've taken the day of work to wait for my parcel on the 25th of Sep. I  got sent en email to say it was gong to be delivered. I called them a couple of times to make sure it was going to as i couldn't take another day of work and I was reassured that it would be and that they delivered up until 9 o'clock at night.9 o'clock came and I got Notification saying that the delivery was delayed and would be delivered on the 28th of Sep.Now by this point i was so annoyed, I had taken the day off work and lost £80 because of it. My item will take another 3 days to be delivered which I will have to take today off work again which I will have to lose another £80.It is unacceptable for $1 billion dollar company like Apple to use mickey mouse companies for their deliveries.
cie_B	Oli	2015-09-20T22:00:00Z	1	Worst customer service ever. Based on my experience in the Covent Garden Apple Store today i will not be buying any other Apple product. This is a largely unethical and greedy corporation which has no consideration for individual service of it customers (or indeed its staff across the world).
cie_B	Julien Dufour	2015-09-17T22:00:00Z	1	Let's be frank, I don't mind spending for quality products. Since I buy Macs, I always bought the best full price with top configuration.I am a professional photographer as well as a business man and this mac is such disappointment as well as the way Apple treats the problem.Bought the mac in July, it went 3 times on repair, came back every time with problem unfixed. This Mac just don't operate well, it's very slow.Problem unsolved and not being able to work, I decide to send an email to M. Tim Cook. after one day a lady calls saying she will solve the problem, she only sent me to another repair center and I am still facing the same problem.Having a defect on a problem is no arm if you react and fix the situation.But spending 3 months without reacting is BAD. If I could get rid of this computer i get a macbook air or get back to a PC. Over with mac for me.
cie_B	Christina	2015-09-16T22:00:00Z	1	last week I sent in my iPhone 6 (bought less than a year ago) to Apple via their UPS send in service. I contacted Apple chat to track my repair package two days ago with no avail/ answer to where my iPhone is after a 1 hour conversation, even though UPS tracking shows that the package has been received at the Apple facility in San francisco on Monday. This is not acceptable. My receipts from UPS, repair number and case number were all passed to Apple. Please be wary of sending in your Apple device for repair.
cie_B	Randy Dillard	2015-09-11T22:00:00Z	1	I had a problem no tech agent had ever experienced. I did the typical troubleshooting steps, and it took me 11 (that's eleven) calls to finally speak with someone who would do more than ask me to turn my phone off and on. The three senior advisors I spoke to refused to give me a replacement phone even though I was under warranty, and required me to reset my phone to factory settings. This is after I missed countless calls, including a job offer. After resetting my phone the problem subsided for 2 and 1/2 months when it arose again. I called and demanded to speak to a senior advisor which authorized a phone exchange. Two days later after receiving my new phone and losing all of my data for a second time (they were afraid restoring it could be the cause of the problems) a new problem arose where my phone would lose all connectivity and only work on wifi. I reset my phone yet again, and the very next day the phone resets itself and only shows an apple screen, followed by a blank screen, followed by a blue screen of death, followed by another blank screen. This went on for 30 minutes before the phone became usable again. This is when I call again, and demand to speak a supervisor. I tell them I demand an upgrade on my phone since I have been receiving poor service for 6 months. Artemis the senior advisor tells me he is the ultimate authority in Apple (I kid you not, I asked if he has the same authority as the CEO of the entire company and he tells me yes I do). After demanding to speak to customer relations he transfers me to another low rankin tech person, who connects me to his senior advisor Michael Perry. I sit on hold for 45 minutes waiting to speak with customer relations and at 11:30 PM I tell him I would like to try again tomorrow. He calls me at 6:30 like requested, and attempts to connect me to customer relations. I kid you not it has been 2 hours and 28 minutes on hold. Apple has given me easily the worst experience of my entire 22 year life, and they seem to think it is a joke. I will share this with every friend I have and request you do the same until I get someone to answer my call.After speaking with Anna Whittemore, I've learned that like Artemis, she is the living incarnate of Apple. Anyone higher than her can't be bothered by us simple regular folk, so they have bestowed upon her the power of the almighty Apple. I should feel fortunate to have only waited 3 hours and 15 minutes to speak to such a deity. She offered me a printer for my trouble.
cie_B	Julien	2015-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	"Brand new Mac book Retina 13"", price: 3,000 USD.Crash, freeze, Not responding, very slow, unstable, doesn't work.It went 3 times on repair, they changed the logic board and still doesn't work. Apple doesn't want to change it, I am living a nightmare calling, explaining the situation and nobody reacts. They totally let me down.Also feel some electricity in the laptop chassis, very very disagreeable. Apple says it's normal...It's my 3rd mac, I clearly feel a big decline in terms of quality and service. Wouldn't buy it at all and don't trust Apple anymore, bad experience. I would have ranked them best company before this horrible experience."
cie_B	Dasha Kina	2015-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I am raging. my apple ID was remotely hacked and highjacked, so I could not use my iphone and had no access to any of my data. After I went to Apple store, they have looked at me as if I have STOLEN MY OWN PHONE and rejected to help me!!!!! told me to go sort this stuff out at Three, where I initially bought my phone. At Three,when the worker found the core of the problem, they were kind enough to at least provide me with the phone to call Apple tech team.thanks guys. So I was put trough to a senior Apple tech advisor after a junior one wasnt getting what is happening, who told me to send proof of a purchase, what luckily I did have(even though I bough a devise 3 YEARS ago) and promised that the problem is going to resolve within 3 working days and they will contact me directly. So it is the end of 4th day and I still havent heard back from anyone, and the hackers can access all my personal stuff!! what I have learnt about Apple, is that you guys care just about the sales, not customers. Utterly disappointed in Apple and still dont know what to do with my iphone, cos it is not working. Moreover, I am super upset about the safety of my data on the phone. How come it is so easy to hack and highjack someone Apple ID??? #nosafetywithApple

cie_B	Nikolaj	2015-08-19T22:00:00Z	1	2 software updates within 4 months - equals 2 burned out brand new batteries and a new touch screen.. iPlanned Obsoleschene is going great im sure if you ask apple, but quite expensive for a product not greater than any other cheap chinese phone on the market.. Same thing with iPod, can only recomend all people to go for the knock off brand with an orange logo instead, since its lifespan is at least double the time and 10% of what you are paying for this crook product..WITH OUT A DOUBT THE BEST TRASHY PRODUCT SINCE NON RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES OR PLASTIC FORKS.. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU CHOOSE ANY OF THESE LOW QUALITY PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, YOU MIGHT EVEN GET A ANDROID THATS FASTER, BETTER AND WITHOUT A DOUBT CHEAPER AND YOU WOULDNT HAVE TO GET IT TO A SERVICE CHECK AS SOON AS SOMETHING NEW ARRIVES IN THE UPDATE OR A SIMPLE APP THAT WILL MAKE SURE YOUR PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK AGAIN

Even when it looks like there's no hope, such as when i couldn't get my Mac book in for repairs, they sent some one round free of charge to pick it up.Also the phone line and online chat offers advice from either Americans or British nationals which makes it easy to understand.Always overwhelmed by their exceptional service.

It's right them product are beautiful design and big performance but the hard disk is of 512Go. Performance ok. Space disk anough. Cost is high. The best is disk is SSD.  Fast work. What do you think ?
cie_B	Lenny	2015-07-29T22:00:00Z	3	I cannot stress enough how much stress an hassle your phone products have caused me over the past years. When working correctly, it is an awesome tools that I use to make a living and keep clients organized. However, my current phone and the 2 previous before that all have experienced the same problem, and that is losing the ability to gain any charge from any kind of charger that I use for it (I have used multiple). Not to mention the battery life on all of these phones have been terrible, I may as well go get myself a land line for my home as my phone always seems to be hooked up to a wall charging. I really want to switch to a different brand however I have a lot of money and music on  I tunes I do not want to lose. Any suggestions as to how to transfer itunes files over to a different format or how to solve the problem of phones not getting charged? I am sick and tired of having to physically hold my phone into a certain position just so it can get a little battery life and don't want to keep doing this in the future
cie_B	Adam Reed	2015-07-21T22:00:00Z	5	For starters can I offer a bit of advice, don't call up, don't pop into the store. Always use their online Live chat it seems to be miles ahead of the other departments never had a single issue with it and once your issue is sorted there your reference number will when taken in store gets you a no quibble straight to the point solution. Also if you don't get your solution sorted the first time, try try and try again you'll get the right person to handle it eventually. As for professionalism 10/10, every time.Easy quick solutions? 9/10, depending on your issue of course.  Consistency, this is where they seem to fall a little mainly just due to the individual person you get on the other end 7/10.Overall, honestly I cannot fault them as most if not all issues you have will be down to human error & the individual assigned to your support request. They're professional, know what they're talking about and swift in their solutions.Experience: Been using their support systems from the iPhone2G on wards.
cie_B	Brandee Ogunjobi	2015-07-19T22:00:00Z	1	"APPLE...wow. Your policy on turning in a device for warranty is awful. I should not have to pay you to exchange my device under warranty. I didn't want to drive to your store and spend time in the store dealing with a rep, I don't want to be without a phone as you suggested by sending me an empty box to ship you my phone, and I don't want to give you $800 until you get my phone and then ""prove"" there is no water damage. And your Manager conveniently got disconnected while booking my ""appointment""...terrible service today Apple.My husband had a problem with his Samsung. They sent him a phone, he sent in his phone. That was it.I can't believe Apple is playing this game with their customers. Your cost for that iPhone is paid 10x over the cost which to you should now be pennies on the dollar. I am sorely disappointed as I have never turned in an iPhone in the last few years of being a loyal customer, and now am being treated like a criminal. I am seriously thinking of leaving Apple for Samsung due to this terribly policy for me and because you force your employees to implement this bogus policy make them stand in the forefront to be harassed by angry customers on your bad policy's behalf. Shame On Apple"

cie_B	Lena Fowles	2015-06-28T22:00:00Z	1	This review won't make a difference to anything. Apple have my money now and you're probably going to buy the apple product anyway. I can not wait for the day that they get wiped out. I recently bought a watch online for a gift for somebody. The customer received after the purchase was absolutely shocking. I was trying to get the delivery sent to a different address so it could be taken abroad with me to give to the person.This didn't happen and every step I followed correctly. I have spent hours on the online chat and phone to customer services who seem incapable of addressing any persons issue. Its like they have a script and just say the same thing again and again. The online chat person kept saying they couldn't help me and to call someone. whats the point in an online chat if they can help?! Fuming!!!!!
cie_B	Alisya Astunc	2015-06-07T22:00:00Z	5	I really love apple products. Apple is the best producer of phones, mac book, watches, iPod and iPad. Especially the apple store which have the best apps ever. love it!

cie_B	Luke	2015-06-05T22:00:00Z	2	"My iPhone 5 had a corruption in the firmware meaning that I had no network  to make calls or use my data. The bar in the top right of my screen would yoyo between full service and ""Searching..."".I had to visit the Genius Bar three times to get this issue addressed. The first time, after booking a specific time slot, I waited over 40 minutes before leaving unserved. The second time I waited 30 minutes after arriving on time for my slot. They confidently told me a DFU restore would solve my issue, which I tried, however on returning home to restore my iPhone via iTunes, the same problem persisted, except it was worse.On returning to the Genius Bar again, they told me there was nothing more they could do for me and I would either have to buy a new handset outright or contact my network supplier. I did contact my network supplier and am now happy with my new Android phone, which I bought with the money made from recycling my iPhone."

Their products can't be be, but when you need support that can be a problem. It's best to avail yourself to their online resources as opposed to going to a local store.
cie_B	Henrik Riis	2015-05-26T22:00:00Z	1	I got an iPad air for my birthday. After 3 months it suddenly had a crack in the glass. It has not been dropped or hit. I contacted the vendor who informed me that Apple did not want to help. In fact the vendor told me that it was not even possible to get the screen fixed because Apple has not released new glass as a spare part yet?! This means effectively that I have a device with a broken screen that I can get fixed officially - if I get it fixed by a street shop I loose all warranty. Nice way for Apple to get rid of a lot warranties due to their ridiculously fragile screens
cie_B	sebile	2015-05-25T22:00:00Z	1	I have literally nearly ALL APPLE PRODUCTS. First time i went in Apple store Reading because I had problem with my old iPhone 4s. I insured my phone with Endsleigh insurance company but they could not  repair my phone and took it to Apple store. Apple declined to inspect the phone because was opened by insurance. I have iPhone 3 3GS, iPhone4 and 4S, iPhone 5 , iPod the oldest one, iPad the old and newest one as well also I have Macbook pro and MacBook Air.  STILL I CAN EVEN PROVE THAT I HAVE THEM . Apple LOST A CUSTOMER LIKE ME WHO WAS BUYING ALL MODELS. I WONT BUT ANYTHING MORE.

cie_B	RYAN PHOENIX	2015-05-21T22:00:00Z	1	Apple design their power supplies to disintegrate within weeks through thin insulation and weak components, resulting in the customer purchasing new power adapters on regular basis which boosts their profit greatly.I had enough of being ripped off by Apple, so I wrote a letter to their head office in Ireland addressed to customer service regarding this issue. I posted the letter via Royal Mail first class recorded, I never received a reply...

cie_B	Estelle Fowden	2015-05-10T22:00:00Z	1	I will never buy another Apple Product. I wanted to buy an IPAD for my dear sister in law as a special present for a special birthday. I ordered it the week before from Apple site because I wanted it engraved. I explained to Sales that we were going away and didn't want it delivered until the following Wednesday. They said that they would make sure it wasn't and to ignore any emails which did not acknowledge this as all emails were automated and couldn't be changed (eh, this from an IT Company - should have rung warning bells). The delivery instructions were not followed through. On our return on the Tuesday, I found that UK Mail had tried to deliver it twice so I went online and arranged for delivery on Thursday (figured to late to ask for Wednesday). Received an email confirming delivery on Thursday. On that day telephoned Apple to ask them to confirm it. They refused to do anything and said it was my responsibility to contact UK Mail !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Telephoned UK Mail and was told goods had been delivered and signed for by Borat. I told them they definitely had not and they then said that they would investigate and call me back. After two hours I called them back and spoke to someone else who said this time that they had been returned to the Apple Depot and gave me a local number to call. Telephone number turned out to be unobtainable. Called Apple again and spoke to a Jonathan in Belfast who said he would organise for the IPad to be delivered on Saturday. We were going away to Kent for the birthday party, but my son, who was planning to visit a friend in Essex before joining us on the Sunday for the party, said he would stay and wait. Late afternoon on the Friday though I received an email saying I was to expect delivery that say. Needless to say that the IPad was not delivered either day. So I had a day off work and lost a day's pay  and my son wasted a day - surely a compensation payment would be due if I took it to court. To avoid disappoint to my sister in law I went and purchased one from Currys on the Sunday and cancelled the order with Apple. More money because I had to ring from my mobile. Let's see how long it takes to recover the money they have taken on my credit card. Rubbish service, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. And to add insult to injury, Apple telephoned me from Luxembourg? (the man had a French accent) and intimated that if I ordered something else from Apple now they might be able to give me something to compensate for all of this trouble. When I enquired what that might be he said an IPAD cover. HA ........  And this saga is still going on, because despite our cancelling the order, the IPad was delivered this morning on the Monday before we returned home. I have had to contact Apple once again to arrange collection.  I wait to see how long it will take for this to happen and for my account to be refunded.  Watch this space.

cie_B	Cooper Danks	2015-03-03T23:00:00Z	4	"I have recently purchased a brand new iPhone6 Plus and wanted to share its advantages & disadvantages with you. I would like to start off by saying that it has a very big display (5.5 Inches), improved battery life performance, outstanding camera quality, solid structure (material wise) and it provides excellent call quality. On the other hand, it’s quite big (when compared with previous models), almost impossible to operate single-handedly, If adding a case (cover) to it, it becomes way-too-big, takes very long to charge, and the operating system is too “lethargic"". However, since I am an apple enthusiast, I would recommend you get one too."
cie_B	gerd59	2015-02-27T23:00:00Z	5	I bought my iPad Air (64 GB, WiFi and Cellular) in summer 2014. About 8-10 weeks ago I noticed a dust particle under the display of my iPad. First I tried to ignore the particle because it was small (about 1mm), but I failed: every single day I had to look at this little flaw. Yesterday I went to the Apple Store in Sindelfingen (near Stuttgart). The friendly service assistant looked at my iPad, admitted that the flaw is annoying - and gave me a new iPad (new, not refurbished!). The whole process took not longer than 15 minutes. Great service, I am delighted!Gerhard J.

I just forked out a grand for a brand new mac book pro with retina display and it is the best money i have ever spent, the quality is undeniable. Also id strongly advised against getting the air just because its cheaper buying paying that little bit more for a pro is so worth it !can't comment on customer service because i didn't need any, website is beautiful and easy navigate parallel to their products and delivery is snappy.

cie_B	Jason Payne	2015-02-07T23:00:00Z	2	"If you know me very well at all, you realize I am a big Apple fan and advocate. When I decided to return to school I was so out -of-touch with the tech world so I decided to purchase a 13"" Macbook Pro the first year and an iPad the second. I had been an iPhone enthusiast for some years. In November, after downloading the new Yosemite operating system, my Macbook would only reboot about a third of the way. Since I had purchased AppleCare, I called for help (waited 50 mins to speak to the person that could help at all) I was directed to a Senior Associate who was very helpful. These were the steps: (1) put in a order for an engineer to recommend a solution and his answer would take 4 days (2) then the Associate called and informed me on what to do and the computer had to set for the rest of the day to finish the first process (3) next day- more steps (4) purchased a 100.00 external hard drive--finally a working computer after 7-8 days. If you have ever been in nursing school without a computer, it sucks!Last week, like a fool, downloaded an update.......same freaking thing happened! Computer would only boot 1/3 way up....called Apple Care-waited 3 days for the engineer's response...asking me to do the very same thing over again, I said NO.I've been at the Apple Sore in Green Hills Mall since 5:30 and I have learned a few things about Apple as a whole, AppleCare, and what Apple seems to be concerned about and what they see as your issue or responsibility. I was told by their associates:1. Associate: You are gonna have to take your Macbook over to MacAuthority or somewhere and have your data backed up (which you will have to pay for) and then bring it back here after that and we will clear your computer and reinstall our software.Me: Could I possibly loose some of my data? for instance, I probably have 3-4000$ worth of Nursing Textbooks and several research papers just to name a few things.Associate: We don't deal with your data, that will be your responsibility--Apple is only responsible for putting our software back on there.Me: (in my ignorance) So if iCloud doesn't back up my data what is it for?Associate: its only our responsibility to make sure the software is on there and your responsible for your data.In conclusion, I wanted to post this article to let those of you that are considering an Apple product to realize a few facts:1. if you download a new operating system or an update by Apple and it screws up your computer-[to my surprise]-all Apple can offer you is to clear your computer, reinstate their software (after you have paid to have your data backed-up) and your left with possible loss of data that they don't deal with.2. AppleCare only covers the hardware of the computer and allows you to call and get help if you don't understand something-{I know Apple is having major software issues, because I previously have called in the past and spoken to someone in about 5-10 mins max--now when you call its 45-60 mins to get to a human}--I should have taken the customer service guy's advice that told me that if it was him he wouldn't download the Yosemite until all the bugs were worked out of it.3. Just because Apple was once an awesome company does not mean they are concerned about the same things that are important to you--just go online and try to find a number that you can talk to someone in their complaint department....let me know if you find such a number. Also, don't think that Apple will make sure you always have a working computer whether you have AppleCare or not. They are not going to give you a device to work on until yours is repaired, there is a very good chanced that your are going to be without a computer from time to time-especially when they put out a new operating system or suggest an update.--I really hope that we haven't seen the best of Apple's days--I love the way Apple's founder thought, and how he made such an effort to design programs that would make the device make sense to the user---I struggle to think that Apple has seen it's best days."

cie_B	Faithosher	2014-12-05T23:00:00Z	1	I have never seen stupid laws of ownership like that of apple. My son (11yrs) had put in an email that doesn't exist on iCloud and the ipad cannot be used to it's full potential because he cannot verify the account. (Well the email doesn't exist like they know themselves). They said tht they need a proff of purchase that I no longer have and cannot obtain...anyway... They have it in their records that I have called in January 2013 reporting a problem that was solved for this same ipad. I have offered them to link the ipad in question with the new one that I have so if there should be any claim regarding the ipad they know where to find me. THEY SAID NO I also offered to send them a copy of my passport. THEY SAID NO! that they need a proof of purchase. I CANNOT PROVIDE IT! So that's it??? I can not use my Ipad anymore to it's full potential? Is there anyone who can help me? I am so upset with them. This is absolutely wrong. Apple are very good product but if I get treated like a thief for my on property... Then there is a problem. WHAT A SHAME APPLE. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU. Case: 708 646 269LISE
cie_B	Stephen Isherwood	2014-11-17T23:00:00Z	1	So Apple are supposed to be this great  innovative, customer friendly company. So why have they incorrectly taken £120 from my account and refused to give it back - even when they admit they are in the wrong. If you want to read the most utterly pointless response from a customer service have a look below. I'm going to go into an Apple store, take something worth £120, then refuse to pay because I don't have the means to process the payment.Hi Stephen,[Name] here, from iTunes Store Support.I’ve been able to review your case in-depth, and I can confirm that the other advisors you’ve spoken with are correct, we will not be able to offer a refund for these charges. That being the case, I would like to address your questions directly.The main reason we are not able to issue a refund is due to the date that the charges were made. Although the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions state that all sales are final, if we are notified of a billing issue within 90 days of the purchase or auto-renewal occurring we typically are able to make an exception and provide a refund. Past 90 days, our ability to issue refunds becomes very limited, and under these circumstances we are not able to offer a refund outside of this 90 day window. For reference, you can review the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions here:You also asked me to clarify why we did not prevent the duplicate billing from occurring, given that the subscription is the same whether you subscribe with publisher directly or through us. The duplicate billing was allowed to occur as there is not a system or process in place that confirms whether or not you are already subscribing through the publisher. I will certainly be submitting your feedback through my internal channels. I will be requesting the addition of features that prevent duplicate billing from occurring under these circumstances and changes to our procedures that allow for exceptions to be made under these circumstances outside of our normal 90 day refund window. I encourage you to submit feedback as well so that it’s seen twice.I regret that we were not able to assist further on this case, but please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Best regards, [Name]iTunes Senior Advisor

Staff hadn't a clue what was going on and gave out wrong information to customers regarding returns/ replacements .Caused massive inconvenience to go back TWICE, only to have to return a third time because of misinformation .Not impressed with my visits.Its far too busy, understaffed who require training ! Shall not visit or buy from this store
cie_B	Fran IronManager	2014-10-07T22:00:00Z	1	"Been waiting for almost 10 days for the delivery of my brand new iPhone 6...I've also asked my company to work from home the whole week to accept the delivery...the TNT driver never turned up at my premise and claimed on their system that ""the receiver was not at home""...How ridiculous! After a couple of calls to Apple and TNT every day I found out today (08th Oct) that my iPhone is now being returned to Apple...I feel I've been treated like a fool and I'm shocked how Apple didn't really do anything to get this right...I will receive a full refund of my purchase in the next few days (hopefully) but I've been left empty handed, with no compensation for the terrible disservice and a strong negative sentiment against the Apple brand...if I ever want to buy an Apple product again it seems that the only way to do that is going to an Apple Store...what a world class customer service!"
cie_B	Susan Russell	2014-10-03T22:00:00Z	3	Foolishly downloaded the new date.  Mini iPad was wiped and is now back in the shop having software reinstalled.  Some iPad apps no longer work properly on old iPad.
cie_B	Jess berry	2014-10-01T22:00:00Z	2	"I love apple, and have most of their products.  I am tech savvy person.  I just have called the line in the past to ask a few questions regarding apple questions, and they were less than nice about it.  I work at a tech support line.  I get the aggravation of people calling it.  I would say that I would NEVER interrupt the client talking to tell her what to do.  In the middle of trying to describe what I did, they proceeded to tell me what I  have already done to solve the problem ( Hence why I called in, because what they were suggesting WASN'T working).  They gave me no speaking time to tell them that, and they told me to "" LISTEN!"" I refuse to listen to anyone with a condescending tone, after they won't LISTEN.  I get that your products are reliable, but I don't just pay for a great product.  I think of it as investing in a company that is backed by people that are just as reliable and can provide positive customer service."

cie_B	Nuno Nothin	2014-09-20T22:00:00Z	5	It's not just about the products. It is about the aftercare.I did have a faulty item but Apple were amazing, they replaced the item without quibble on one occasion. On a separate occasion I mistakingly bought an app for £50 that I did not need, they were once again great. Refunding me without quibble.Based on that service we have not spent in excess of £3000 with them and have no intention of going elsewhere.Thank you Apple
cie_B	Lilith H.	2014-09-11T22:00:00Z	2	I'll spare you the details but I've been trying to order a macbook pro with a Danish keyboard, and Apple has managed to get this wrong twice. So I now have two macbooks, both of which will be returned to Apple because their customer service and sales team have made so many mistakes that I can't even start to count them. When I spend £1,400 on a computer I do actually expect to receive the right item, and a fairly decent service. Apparently not.
cie_B	Sebastian Albert Brink Ladefoged	2014-08-22T22:00:00Z	1	I have waited 29 days for my bag to come. Apple send me a mail 5 days ago that said that they didn’t have any bags left but at that time i had allready waited for 15 days for my order to come. Now they finally send me a mail that says my order is on its way and it will be there on the 29th august. It took them almost a moth for them to sent me a bag i payed 600 kroner for plus delievry on 50kroner. I expected more from a big company as apple.. bad service and loose work! I'm still waiting for my bag..
cie_B	Chris	2014-08-16T22:00:00Z	1	I am sick of my iMac now, just unboxed another brand new iMac (replacement) and this also seems to have a bad logic board just as the original iMac I owned had and the replacement sent for that 2 weeks ago and now this replacement that came just the other day. I have lost so much money with not having my computer for the last 6/7 weeks, I am gutted that this iMac now has the same fault. You have an error in you're manufacturing process some where, 3 imacs in a row with bad logic boards! this is just unacceptable - I am going to be pursuing a full refund plus the money I have lost and the customers I have lost also as a result, I will be looking to seek legal help if this matter is not finally resolved. PLEASE DO NOT BUY IF YOU NEED THIS MACHINE FOR YOUR INCOME!!!!!!

cie_B	Haydee	2014-07-09T22:00:00Z	1	I swear to you I will never ever purchase another apple product. They are over priced for the quality.  You would think you spend so much on an item that it would last longer than a few years.  I'm am done. Customer service sucks too, they take your money and if you don't buy protection they say the heck with you. The crazy thing is I never buy protection plans but this is one that if you don't your out of luck. Trust me it won't work past a yr if that.
cie_B	Dan	2014-07-04T22:00:00Z	4	The store is very helpful, the website is very helpful and the products are good and super simple to use. I have the iPad with retina display, mac pro, macbook Pro, iPod 4th g, iPhone 4s and they are all great and work well together, only problems is the not so genius, genius phone support, although the store genii (if thats the plural) are quite good. In my opinion the products are overpriced though and you cant configure to order and pick up in store, which is a pain, especially when I was ordering my mbp as my instore options were limited
cie_B	Lise Kampmann	2014-06-19T22:00:00Z	5	Simply just great
cie_B	Andrew	2014-06-10T22:00:00Z	1	I generally love Apple's products and have always been a fan, however the faulty on/off button on my iphone4S and the way Apple have done nothing to help me has resulted in this 1 star review.Despite the many thousands of comments online from fellow customers stating there is a problem with the iphone 4S power button not working after a period of time, and a simular problem with the iphone 5's - Apple have point blank refused to fix the problem for 4S customers. Instead they are only sorting the issue for people with an iphone 5. This is an insult to add to the injury Ive already experienced in having a phone I cant turn on and off properly through no fault of my own.When I initally reported the problem over a year ago, I was told I would have to pay to have it repaired. UNACCEPTABLE. Why should a customer have to pay for a known fault? In calling back again today after hearing about the iphone 5's being fixed free of charge, I was told by the Automated voice that if I want support I have to pay a one off charge of £25.00?!?!?!?!?!???!!!!!I really cant belive Apple would treat its customers this way. It really is so bad. Im now due an upgrade and I will be thinking long and hard about my options....!!

cie_B	Jeffery Dirken	2014-04-29T22:00:00Z	3	I have to agree with some of the other reviews that Apple after Steve Jobs definitely isn't what it used to be. Instead of focusing on what's most important like innovating and coming with new product ideas that inspire us, now all they do is add a little bit more ram, a little more memory, a little bit bigger screen, and just make incremental improvements. Nothing that really Wows you. I guess they couldn't just wow us forever but I hoped they would. Anyway, I still use mostly all Apple products for my day to day work and activities. Even though the quality is still pretty good... it just ain't what used to be... and the direction they are heading in... pretty soon they'll just be about average compared to the rest of the competition.
cie_B	Jamie Penney	2014-04-13T22:00:00Z	2	Was not confident my order was going through correctly as it was stating it would be dispatched in 24 hours but 72 hours later i came frustrated so i phone customer services and the bloke said everything was fine so i left it for a few more hours and rang again and the lady said that my address did not match and had to correct it and will take an extra 24 hours to dispatch so i was fuming! Take into account that i took 2 days of work to sign for delivery! Not happy!
cie_B	Ryan Ross	2014-04-12T22:00:00Z	4	I hardly need to shout about their products- you all know they're fantastic and at the top of the pile. So to the site.I have ordered a few accessories from Apple before, and they've always arrived when they say they will. The only issue is that accessories, such as the earphones I bought, tend to be a little pricier than elsewhere. In this case around 15% more than on Amazon.However- one of the great pros of shopping with Apple, is that if there's an issue you can go into an Apple store and get a refund or a replacement. That to me is worth the extra 15%. I wouldn't fancy having to navigate an Amazon third party refund. More power to Apple!
cie_B	Olivia Foster	2014-02-26T23:00:00Z	5	Love The product, Love the apple design.Battery has to be improvedOverall Very good and Recommend the product
cie_B	Jonathan Leathem	2014-02-24T23:00:00Z	1	"Didn't have a good experience with AppleDecided after a lot of consideration to purchase a MacBook Pro last week.  Got it home , adapter missing.  Apple initially refused to assist on Apple Care looking my credit card details to send me a replacement and blackmailing me that if I didn't send a part back I would be charged !  How can I send a part back when it wasn't there in first place.When I got home noticed that the seal of the box (of a supposedly brand new MacBook) was opened and when I took the MacBook out of the box it was warm!!!!  I am guessing that Apple tried to palm of a refurbished computer as brand new one to me!Decided to take MacBook back, was given a supposed refund (part cash with the rest on my card).  Wasn't given a refund confirmation.  Asked three times for one via email and eventually sent something.  Asked when I would expect my refund they said refer to your bank.  On Monday contacted store again asked when my refund would go through.  Staff member said ""ask your bank, not my problem!.Certainly not impressed with the way I have been treated by apple.  Contacted Managing Director of Apple UK, email ignored.  Don't see how anyone can get so excited about apple and their supposed high level of customer service.  I haven't seen an example of this and quite the opposite."

The neat little box came via UPS, and the macbook is simply beautiful - no creaking or wobbly hinges, lightening-fast (I mean it, Windows 7 in a virtual machine is about 10-20x faster than I have ever seen in on any real hardware), and the software is well thought through, functional and beautiful too. The only drawbacks are the astronomical prices (yes, I think Macs are worth more than the average laptop, but that much more?), and that you are really committing yourself fully to Apple.

cie_B	Carl Creasy	2013-08-28T22:00:00Z	1	My partner purchased me an iPhone 4 for my birthday 2 years ago and just after the 1 year mark started to get very hot. Initially thought it was the case that I was using so removed it. Made a little difference but after the iOS 6 update got much worse to the point it got so hot it left a red mark on my partners hand.I contacted the Aftercare team and they were less than helpful they said as this was out of warranty I would have to pay to replace the hand set. I think not. I then complained to the UK CEO who though did not contact me directly got one of his staff to. To start off all was looking good. They said that this did not seem normal so would get the phone back to them in Cork to look at.After being without a phone for nearly a week I email to be told that the lady dealing with my case had been trying to call even thought I told her I had no phone. After she called my partner I was informed that it had been linked to the diagnostics but they had no evidence that phone had ever got dangerously hot. Even though it had been through 3 full resets in the time frame of this farce.I was emailed that the phone would be returned to me and that if I can take it to a store with the heat they may do something about it. The phone was returned and within 20 mins of powering it back up I had to put it down as it was so hot.Emailed my contact again and the CEO as was outraged. To be told that she wanted to call me to speak to me after requesting via email so I have it in writing Now no response at all.Sham company get your money then don't care about customer care or safety!Me and all my friends will not purchase apple ever again disgraceful company shocking aftercare and £££ down the toilet.

cie_B	Gregers Kronborg	2013-06-14T22:00:00Z	1	EXPERIENCE 1 (See experience 2 below)I had a very frustrating and time wasting experience with Apple ... in particular their store in Regents Street London. I had bought a brand new iPhone 5 for my wife. However, when she started using it the receiver was abviously faulty as the sound was scratchy all the time. I booked at support time at Apple. I went there, and they confirmed that the phone was under warranty, they tested the phone, and confirmed that it would be repaired or replaced within next half hour. So I went for a walk. When I returned they said that they had found a wire missing inside the phone, and concluded that someone had tampered with the phone. I referred to the reseller and explained it was a brand new phone wrapped in the normal packaging. But, they still denied. After consulting with the reseller I mailed the phone for repair. The repair was done with no further discussion, and we have a working phone again. But, I wasted half a day on Apple's arroganza. One star ... maybe they will eventually improve the customer service.EXPERIENCE 2I eventually got a replacement unit cf. above. After three months the head phone jack didnt work anymore. I tried several times to book a genius time slot in Regents Street. But, when I had picked an available time and entered my personal info ... the website tells med the slot is gone. It did so 5 times in a row. Then I went a week forward to a day where there were plenty of open slots. Same same. Very efficent customer service denial function. The solution is to go to a non Apple repair shop. And you know what ... then all warranty is over. I must do another try with Android ... this arrogance must be punished.

cie_B	Tomey Stone	2013-03-27T23:00:00Z	5	i just received my ipad 4 from them i have to praise again to apple they did it once again very fast tablet great features and great tablet had android tablet before could not stand it decided to try the ipad 4 and was not disappointed
cie_B	Jimbo Willis	2013-03-26T23:00:00Z	5	Not a bad word to say about Apple. Their products are great as is their service. Been buying from Apple from years and would definitely recommend to any still on Windows who hasn't found a Mac yet.
cie_B	Shania Mraz	2013-03-15T23:00:00Z	5	iphone is great but phone made from glass one drop and it will brake but i cant live with out my iphone so APPLE please the next iphone make it more durable
cie_B	Craig Minihan	2013-01-23T23:00:00Z	5	... the right products and excellent customer service in store.The only problem here is the dubious factory conditions experienced by workers in China and elsewhere in Asia. Sorry Apple, even if not true this sticks to your reputation. If I'm paying £££ for your products I'm expecting you to be 100% beyond reproach.I own a Macbook Pro Retina and numerous iPads, iPhones and iPods.
cie_B	Judy	2012-11-25T23:00:00Z	5	Listen, I am not a techie expert. I am a customer who has been ripped off, burned, ripped off again and raked over the coals. I learned my lesson(s) and went with Apple for my techie products (Mac comp, ipod, ipad, etc) and all I know is that they are superior products! I am probably only using 1/8 of what my Mac is capable of doing and I accept that. Have I been hacked, gotten a virus, lost my *$#%^ hard drive and all the files on it.....NO! My Mac is steady and true and gives me such a feeling of confidence and gratitude-yes, I'm grateful that I can expect--and receive super fast responsiveness, no glitches, pop ups, etc. and music at my fingertips---just really awesome, superior service from hot looking, sleek equipment. So keep your expert, arguing, bullying comments to yourselves, technotards--I don't want to hear it. I love my APPLE!
cie_B	Robert Bishop	2012-11-02T23:00:00Z	5	Samsung make great products, including arguably the best smartphone. However, before the iPhone came out , Samsung were going down a massively different route from what you see of the galaxy 3. The iPhone and apps really shook up the world. I had no great interest in always having a mobile phone on me until I bought an iPhone. I would be lost without it now. It's the sort of thing that would be considered from Star Trek or Star Wars just a few years ago and now it's almost the norm in developed countries. So, here's to the vision of those great people of Cupertino, I salute you, you have literally changed the world!
cie_B	Benjamin Coulson	2012-10-21T22:00:00Z	5	I purchased my Macbook pro through the online Apple store, which i completely preferred to actually going to an Apple store (I kind of hate Apple stores).  The process was smooth and easy, like pretty much everything apple related plus I was more or less able to build my computer from scratch which was pretty darn cool.  Great site with great products.
cie_B	Denis Smajlović	2012-10-13T22:00:00Z	1	"When i was on vacation, the edge of the dock connector inside it broke after i took the cable out as usual. I thourght - Apple is great! I will just send it in for a repair when i get home. If it was just meant to be so easy. I send it in for repair and got a SMS some days later which told me that the iPad has been physically overloaded and that i can chose to pay DKK 6312,50 for a replacement (64gb 4G (which cannot be used in denmark) orriginal price DKK 5999). I mean if i pay 6312,50 (which is quite a weired number - isn't it?) i will get a whole new iPad. But if i want the ipad back brooken without any cost and then buy a new one inside the same store i will save DKK 313,50 and then have a new AND a brooken iPad. Is this a bad joke er what? I got my iPad back with the impression that Apple is not the place to go next time :-( And now two months later they announce the ""Incredible new LIGHTNING dock connector"". I really hope that it's also just a bad joke, but unfortunally not :-("
cie_B	R Hartley	2012-09-21T22:00:00Z	5	Purchased a iPad last month from the meadow hall shop. The shop,staff and set up was unreal. The shop was rammed and the staff just kept on smiling and were really helpful. since had problem with my iPad and made an appointment with the tech guys . It turned out the problem was me not the iPad . But what I learned about iPads and what they can do is amazing . Really great shop , with a visit !!!!!
cie_B	Jenna Shuman	2012-09-17T22:00:00Z	4	I only wish they would run a sale sometime so the rest of us who are not made of money could afford to buy apple product. I willsay the site is user friendly.
cie_B	Jeppe Rask Schlyter	2012-09-15T22:00:00Z	5	Apple is just awesome. It might cost a little extra money, but it is totally worth it. it just works
cie_B	Maysa Turk	2012-08-31T22:00:00Z	3	I used the store many times I think it's fine, but need some. it provides a good information about each application.
cie_B	Farid Bonawiede	2012-08-31T22:00:00Z	5	They changed my one week old ipad with a cracked screen for free, even without the applecare plan. Actually I had to ask at two different apple stores, because the first one wanted me to pay 300 usd for a new ipad. However, the second place just asked me to get applecare plus and they would replace it for free. 99 usd and 30 minutes later I had a brand new ipad!I am so pleased with the sales rep and manager at Apple store in Miami beach that helped me! Many thanks!
cie_B	Brandon	2012-08-29T22:00:00Z	5	Been an Apple customer for about 10 years now since their clickwheeled iPod.  Wow - has it been that long? ;/Never had an issue with any product, customer service in store and over the phone has been exceptional.  Products are brilliantly made and you can see the passion that goes into their work.
cie_B	Kelly Stunmore	2012-08-29T22:00:00Z	4	This is really more about the apple phone.I love the phone and think its great but my problem is this. I dropped my laptop and had to have a replacement as it was beyond repair. When I then linked my iphone to my new computer I couldnt transfer the songs off the phone back onto the computer but instead lost everything other than stuff I had purchased on the appstore!Think they need to make the software a little easier for people to use.
cie_B	Sydney Polak	2012-08-12T22:00:00Z	5	I hear alot of people complaining about the apple hype and the high prices but so far I didnt find a phone, an mp3 player or a laptop that give me the same quality and genuine design as apple. People might complain - but I believe they have not tried the products before. As a windows user I was always struggling with my pc and I dont have these problems any more since I am using a MacBook pro. Yes, it was expensive but it paid of a hundred times since my laptop would have been down by now and my Macbook still reaches a battery lifetime of 7 hours. My laptop didnt reach that to begin with and it was the same price. So first before complaining: start using apple and I'm 100% sure you will not go back to windows (except when youre an excessive gamer, then, I regret, you have no other choice) :)
cie_B	Joe Wlitshire	2012-08-07T22:00:00Z	3	I'm not a fanboy, but I have an iphone and a macbook pro for work and I can't fault the quality and functionality of the machines. When I got them they were certainly in a league of their own. I think the same is still true of the macbook, but with hints of new jacks (so my bose sounddock no longer works with my iphone) I think I might we be looking at samsung next time. Why? I guess purely the price. Apple gear is great, but an arm and leg is barely even a downpayment (plus they screw UK consumers over big time versus the US - do they deserve our loyalty?). If it was cheaper I might be happy to replace it all, but not at current/accessory prices.
cie_B	Customer: Prof. Brian Bevan	2012-08-03T22:00:00Z	3	Have always been a great fan and follower!But WAY OVER PRICE FOR ACTUAL HARDWARE.When they are competitive My company will purchase and also our clients to whom we are consultants.Oh! how I wish that day would come soon!
cie_B	Gina Winston	2012-08-02T22:00:00Z	5	Great manufacturer, perfect design and performance of all its products and I tried many.
cie_B	Maria Garcia	2012-08-01T22:00:00Z	5	Fantastic phone with tons of useful applications. Love it!
cie_B	Jamie Childers	2012-07-30T22:00:00Z	5	Superior equipment, build and customer service.I have swapped over from a PC to a Macbook pro and couldn't be happier.Software and build is seamless... customer service and store support is always great.Yes they're expensive but as mother always says... you really do get what you pay for :)
cie_B	Frank Adams	2012-07-27T22:00:00Z	2	I could never understand Apple's prices.. I think they are just hyping up their products on purpose.
cie_B	SD	2012-07-25T22:00:00Z	4	I switched to mac almost 6 years ago and haven't looked back since. The seamless nature of having apple products cannot be beaten by anything else. Sure, other companies come out with better ideas for phones etc. but their ideas are normally poorly implemented, and you always need an array of add-ons to make sure that your phone, computer and everything else all stay up to date. With Apple, it just works. People complain about the price, but I say you get what you pay for.My only complaint (hence 4 stars) is Apple Server. It doesn't work out of the box like all other Apple products, and support hasn't been great.
cie_B	Arnold Kopelson	2012-07-24T22:00:00Z	5	I have a PC as well, but my Mac is my love... Great computer and great performance.
cie_B	Neil Dickens	2012-07-24T22:00:00Z	5	Simple as. Customer service is brilliant, I feel they actually want to help me. Delivery is always fast and well packaged.
cie_B	Azra Leith	2012-07-22T22:00:00Z	5	It has great set of functions and is very beautiful looking. The only drawback is its price.
cie_B	Anthony Turner	2012-07-22T22:00:00Z	5	I love my iPhone, it has so many useful applications and options. Top-notch product.
cie_B	Errol Lombard	2012-07-20T22:00:00Z	5	It offers superior design and superior functionality. I'm happy to pay a few extra bucks for something of high quality.
cie_B	Zia Salehian	2012-07-17T22:00:00Z	3	A great deal more has to be done in my view for Apple products to match up to all the hype and bravado.
cie_B	Majo Oommen	2012-07-16T22:00:00Z	5	like the quality of most of the apple products....just bought a macbook 10 months before....still running perfectly without no obstacles.....did recommend for anyone

cie_B	Kaitlin Brightman	2012-07-16T22:00:00Z	5	I have never been disappointed with any Apple products and I have always thought their products are 'from the future.'
cie_B	Ali	2012-07-16T22:00:00Z	2	Its too expensive can't get anything less than a pound and free apps are completely crap!
cie_B	Harshiran	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	4	Apple is fab I love all of there products from I Pods to I Macs.   The only problem most people have is that they cost quite a bit.  I am lucky enough to go to a school that has I pads and I macs and I can go use them every single day but no most people are like me.  Overall the products are fantabulous!
cie_B	Marino Corniel	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	5	As a technician having a reliable company is half the battle.
cie_B	Jason Allen	2012-07-14T22:00:00Z	5	Very satisfied with my iPhone and my Mac... Way better than other brands.
cie_B	Nigel Crawford	2012-07-13T22:00:00Z	5	Apple products may be more expensive than other brands but there is a reason, innovative designs, excellent software solutions and operating systems that work and are not confusing for the user. I've been an Apple user for 20 years and as yet haven't been disappointed. Haven't had much experience because, touch wood, I haven't needed too and that speaks volumes to me as a consumer.
cie_B	Terri Cannon	2012-07-13T22:00:00Z	5	i had my iphone 4s for over 6 month CANT WAIT FOR the iphone 5 to come out WHEN ITS COMING OUT??

cie_B	Michael Lewis	2012-07-11T22:00:00Z	3	"Very pricey. The apple store is always too busy and it gives me a headache. Some of the ""genius"" staff are not very helpful.  I find the OS not very intuitive.Beautiful machines.  Very fast--most of the time. Great graphics, etc."
cie_B	Paul	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	1	screen quality is so poor - family members have had much more done to their non-apple products.

cie_B	Kenny & Lucy Dresner	2012-07-08T22:00:00Z	5	Been using Apple products since 1991 and have been universally satisfied.  The products are great, very user friendly and reliable.

cie_B	Scott	2012-06-28T22:00:00Z	5	I'm a fanboy admittedly, I have MacBook Pro, iPhone & iPad but they are all so easy to use. Great updates, great function, great looking.. Steve Jobs has done a wonderful job, I can't wait to read his book, such an inspiration. I've converted most my mates to the iPhone & due to it's usability & function. Seriously a life tool & not just a phone.
cie_B	ige	2012-06-27T22:00:00Z	1	had an iphone, it sucked.  loved the aps, the phone was poor quality, and it locked up in less than two years.  had an ipod, used it maybe four times in two years when it became a paperweight.  thanks to those experiences, i will never own an apple/mac product.
cie_B	Anthony Kilby	2012-06-26T22:00:00Z	5	Well what needs to be said.... (nothing really) its Apple, its a breeze to use, and the customer support is beyond expectation.It's everything you expect and more.

cie_B	mark	2012-06-23T22:00:00Z	1	Their products have been groundbreaking  for sure , but why does everthing have to be proprietary? An audio cord from my iphone to my  stero should be  universal  and cost $3. Instead it must be an apple cord and cost $40. Pure greed.
cie_B	Ljs	2012-06-22T22:00:00Z	1	Rude, unhelpful customer service staff, took one phone call to convince me that I never ever want to spend my hard earned money on an apple product.

cie_B	Linda	2012-06-20T22:00:00Z	5	The best customer service ever!
cie_B	Nick Hudson	2012-06-19T22:00:00Z	1	I receive an Apple TV as a gift. It died/stopped working shortly after the 90 day warranty expired. Apple refused to stand behind their product and wanted me to pay more than what the product was worth to get any help. Will never buy another apple product, ever again.
cie_B	P.Welton	2012-06-19T22:00:00Z	5	Have ordered a lot of items from Apple direct over the years and have never been let down by their delivery next day, or communication, they are probably as close to perfect as you can get from an online retailer.
cie_B	Ronald Lewis	2012-06-14T22:00:00Z	5	I'm using Apple's products for several years and I'm very satisfied with their performance.

cie_B	M.J. Dean	2012-06-01T22:00:00Z	4	I own Apple everything... Lol. From iPhones to iPads (plural)...  They have great tech support & if ever a problem arises they fix it ASAP... The only problem I have with Apple is THEY'RE GREEDY!!!  They don't give discounts...  Not even to loyal customers... And they make everything out of breakable glass so you can pay $150 to get a replacement if you break an out of warranty phone.  It seems like they're smart enough to use unbreakable glass.
cie_B	Jan Daniels	2012-05-26T22:00:00Z	5	Have purchased several items from different  Apple Stores in the UK and USA and have always found them to be very helpful and nothing is ever too much trouble. The staff always have plenty of time to help you with any questions or problems that you may have. Whether I was purchasing a Mac or a cover for my iphone I have always found the service I have received to be 1st class. Would highly recommend Apple and have definitely been converted from Windows.

cie_B	Sam	2012-05-13T22:00:00Z	1	During the process of using the shops service seems so important. This just doesn't translate to the online store.
cie_B	Margaret Brown	2012-05-13T22:00:00Z	5	I had a charge of £2.99 on my account and didn't know why.   Without question Apple refunded the charge.  Unfortunately, they closed my account at the same time but were quick to re-instate it.I have dealt with them both online and at the store and have never been disappointed in their service.

cie_B	Father Andrew J. Vollkommer	2012-05-13T22:00:00Z	5	I bought my very first Apple product in 1985 and I got bit!  I haven't touched any other computer product since.  I have been a loyal faithful Mac user ever since.  I tried a PC once and almost died (just joking)! But I love Macs and Apple products.  The technology, the service, and the durability are out of this world.  I had a Laser Printer that I bought in 1987 in graduate school that I finally had to get rid of only because you could no longer get the parts for it (toner, etc).  That is how well made their products are!  I now own a MacBook Pro, and 2 iMacs, a IPhone, and a iPad.  I'll remain loyal and true to Apple forever!  Finally I bought 15 shares of Apple Stock five years ago and I am certainly glad that I did.

cie_B	Luisa Peterson	2012-05-07T22:00:00Z	4	I love Apple. My only remark would be about the prices that are a tad too expensive.
cie_B	lilla	2012-05-07T22:00:00Z	1	after paying a lot for the Imac, it never performed at the standard expected by its specs. it overheats quite quickly and the case get incandescent due to the poor ventilation (only via a small opening at the back). as final result after an afternoon of work one of the ram burned making the pc useless just after the warranty expired... we are not that convinced that it is even worth repairing it...
cie_B	dave	2012-05-06T22:00:00Z	1	"ok if you want to use it on its own but dont expect to network it and share resources on the network (printers inparticular).support uselss - ""its a windows problem"" - total rubbish a quick google shows something got broken (or removed) between updates.updates of 1.4G - unreal.keyboard eats batteries.Apple is a triumph of marketing over reality."
cie_B	Ming Tong Lane	2012-05-04T22:00:00Z	4	Each of my family members has at least one apple product whether its an ipad, itouch or macbook. We are just an apple family i guess. Great products and great customer service.
cie_B	Adrian Tooke	2012-05-02T22:00:00Z	5	Can’t believe I have waited so long for something so simple and reliable.  Have been using Microsoft since the early days and can honestly say “I Love Apple”  even my little 3 year old son has mastered the Ipad with ease.  Superb product! Thank you
cie_B	Jeron Halewijn	2012-05-01T22:00:00Z	3	All in all I come more to the conclusion that Apple is too expensive. Furthermore the quick release of so called 'new' products without real change does not support sustainability.Apple should do more about sustainability
cie_B	Hazel L	2012-05-01T22:00:00Z	4	I have a 4S - I've had many Apple products over the years and my main issue has been when switching PCs I've lost songs, names of songs (that may not sound too bad but 1 more lost the name and artist on 1500 songs - try having to identify each song again and see how annoyed you  get with Itunes) - I can't fault the products as they do everything I want an more and keep ahead of the competition but please please sort Itunes.

Set up for all of the apple products are easy and if you do need assistance the choices are abundant. Customer service is top notch. Online, on the phone or at an Apple Store near you.

I feel that they have changed the market in terms of what consumers are happy to accept in relation to design and overall the product itself. A real contender for changing the way we think about things as well as increasing competition. Customer service was very helpful and so polite to both me and other people involved in communications - handled the multiple contact points so professionally.

cie_B	'David Blair	2012-03-30T22:00:00Z	1	The world continues to be conned by Apple. They offer yesterdays technology at state of the art prices! Yes the boxes are pretty but frankly the kit is not! The whole synchronistion thing through iTunes and the restrictions placed upon the user should be the subject of a class action. I find it amazing that although Microsoft were forced to unbundle IE from Windows....Apple is allowed to behave in this way!
cie_B	Dick W.	2012-03-30T22:00:00Z	5	We'd love to buy Apple, just can't afford to.Too many mouths to feed.Hate Microsoft, so we are slowly migrating to Linux.No comparison between a fine company (Apple) and product and one that sells untested software (Windows) and rapes it's customers over and over.
cie_B	Mike	2012-03-29T22:00:00Z	5	Why would I use anything else? Apple's products of late constantly exceed my expectations. The only negative is the desire to upgrade more often than necessary (since their products tend to keep going much longer than competitors do).
cie_B	Liz	2012-03-26T22:00:00Z	5	I ordered an iPad2 online.  From the beginning to end their customer service department kept me informed via email as to the status of my order.  I received a confirmation email, a status on my order, a shipping notification and tracking number.My order was delivered in less than 7 business days
cie_B	W. Webster	2012-03-25T22:00:00Z	5	I brought my 2008 laptop into the apple store. It was completely dead and I expected them to try and sell me a new model or a $500 replacement part. Instead, the genius reformatted my hard drive, installed a new operating system, and the laptop works like a charm. For FREE. My only complaint is even though I had an appointment at the genius bar, I still had to wait an hour because those guys are so popular. They also won't let you leave the store if you have an appointment.
cie_B	Anna Hamel	2012-03-25T22:00:00Z	5	I have used my local Apple store multiple times & as yet have to be disappointed from the greeter all the way through purchase.  I have always had products thoroughly explained & all my questions answered.
cie_B	M.Pastore	2012-03-24T23:00:00Z	1	I don't think Steve Jobs was a genius.He was just an IT company founder.Real geniuses,in computer science,were scientists as Von Neumann,Alan Turing or previously Charles Babbage...or also ICs inventors,for example Robert Noyce or Federico Faggin and many many others...but not people as Steve Jobs.I think apple is just a company,nothing else : no real technology progress,but just implemetation of existing technology).
cie_B	Rickie	2012-03-23T23:00:00Z	3	"The minute I power up my new apple desk top I was disappointed by the new O/S - Lion, I compared it to MicroSoft - Vista or less. It seem apple pushed out the new Lion too soon without iron out the bugs. I mean the network disk I enjoy access and shared with other platform is nolonger accessible under Lion but still works fine with my other machine using Snow Leopard.  As far as I am concern apple destroyed their images with the reason O/S release (MAC and iPhone).  I love Apple product, but their late Lion release is disgusting. If they don't fix up their act, it just a matter of time before the ""KIDS"" pick it up and move on."
cie_B	Stephan Mohr	2012-03-22T23:00:00Z	5	My favourite site on the web!
cie_B	Robert Jennings	2012-03-21T23:00:00Z	4	Apple makes the best quality OS software, a solid suite for organizing your photos, songs, etc, and they package it all in elegant and solid hardware. Their products are expensive but they last longer so you probably recuperate the extra cost. Some of their popular items (most notably the iPad) seem a little frivolous, and are actually more design objects than highly functional machines. I would suggest the MacBook Pro and the iPhone (just don't break or lose it!) for anyone who has the means. Also, don't get locked into an expensive phone contract and data plan.
cie_B	Amsterdam 007	2012-03-20T23:00:00Z	5	I ordered an iPad from them and it arrived in excellent condition. I contacted them afterwards again as I needed help with the installed software and they responded immediately. Prompt delivery and most importantly, friendly and knowledgeable support. Recommended.
cie_B	Deidre Hughes	2012-03-19T23:00:00Z	5	You can't beet them for there knowledge and friendly associates.  They take there time and walk you thru any problem you can possibly have.  They even take the time to each you all the new things that they are upgrading to.  Apple your are #1 in my life
cie_B	Gareth Edmondson	2012-03-19T23:00:00Z	4	I ordered the new iPad when it was released but it didn't arrive until Saturday. I wanted it on launch day,Maybe not Apple's fault but TNT decided their driver was too tired to deliver to me. I had to have it on Saturday morning.Apple - change your delivery team.
cie_B	Elena Ashton	2012-03-17T23:00:00Z	5	As a Graphic Designer, I've used Mac computers for many years. About 6 months ago, I invested in a Macbook Air as I needed something light and powerful for when I have to travel. It still amazes me how much they pack into such a small machine. From the first moment going online to buy until my new computer arrived, it was a total pleasure. Ten out of ten every time.
cie_B	Logan	2012-03-17T23:00:00Z	2	As far as phones and laptops go, Apple is pretty keen on quality products. However, never buy any extras. Apple marks up things like RAM over 1000% (laptop ram is usually around $20-40 but they once tried to sell me 8GB for $400!)For desktops, don't even think about it. My computer has higher specs than their $7k desktop and I bought mine for under $900.

cie_B	Tonysaka	2012-03-13T23:00:00Z	5	The staff here are very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in at 5.30am after arriving by sleeper bus. They booked us a 2 day tour to halong bay which we felt was very good value for money and we had the best time that we had had since being in Vietnam and probably since we started travelling 7 weeks ago! Free breakfast and free drinks all day was great and I would stay here again.
cie_B	Wendy McCormack	2012-03-13T23:00:00Z	5	Have several Apple items now, can't see me using any other company's products to be honest. Very straightforward and user friendly. The Apple Stores are brilliant, what a good attitude they have - as well as buying in the stores you can pop in any time with queries and advice, staff are always helpful and normal.
cie_B	Colin Phelps	2012-03-13T23:00:00Z	4	I have never been an Apple fan. Their equipment  is exceptionally well designed but carries an expensive price tag. Perhaps the good thing is they manufacture the hard and software so standards are high. However the iPhone, itouch, and ipad  are definately the manufacturer telling the customer what to they will have. Only giving them model choices that should not exist. Why not have a slot for memory expansion, why not have an accessible battery? This was a poor decision that certainly cost them the phone and tablet market.Now because of the moronic approach of windows 8 I am going to  an Apple laptop. I will not have an Iphone since I consider the Samsung Galaxy superior. I will not replace my itouch since tablets have superceded it and again Samsung  and many others have overtaken iPad. Even iPad3 made the same mistakes.

cie_B	Alexandra Kaylie Krauss	2012-03-11T23:00:00Z	5	I'm absolutely in love with my apple products.  I first bought the iPod..it was an older one that is no longer sold but it was amazing! I now have the ipod nano and the technology is just astonishing. its so easy to use and I have absolutely no complaints.  I also own a macbook, and after years and years of complete frustration from my PC's, the macbook is heaven-sent! Its life-changingly better for daily use... way less problems and frustration.  Once you get used to the little differences between PC's and Mac's, you will definitely prefer the mac. I can't say enough good things about it.  I also recently got an iPhone 4S.  Another life-changing purchase...life is much simpler, more organized, and entertaining.  I also would like to state that every time I have ever had an issue with my apple product and brought it into an apple store, the employees are always extremely helpful, patient, understanding, and generous! Without fail! I love Apple and trust and prefer their products.
cie_B	Brenda Ramirez	2012-03-10T23:00:00Z	4	I just bought my new computer off of the website and I love how quickly everything was processed and at the speed at which I received my new mac. Gotta love Apple!
cie_B	Jenepher Quinn	2012-03-10T23:00:00Z	5	Apple products are magic, I have an iPad, New Apple Air Computer 11 inch, after having for years a wonderful Apple Mac laptop that has finally died after 10 yrs of faithful service. Its life brought me through writing a book, getting a University degree, an Hons. Degree, and then many photos of my first Grandchild. Yes, I am a silver surfer but couldn't have done it without Apple, long may they continue even though Steve Job is no longer with them.
cie_B	Brenda Silverstone	2012-03-09T23:00:00Z	5	The Apple Iphone is one of my bestest ever purchases. I really dont think I would use any other phone, as the Iphone has me totally hooked. I used to use a Blackberry which is still a good phone, however the Iphone offers so much more in the way of usability and of course the screen is much larger than almost any other phone on the market place in the UK.My husband was so impressed he also upgraded to a new Iphone so we both now have identical phones almost like Twins.I must congratulate Apple on producing a refreshingly good phone and most of all a reliable media phone with great features.
cie_B	robertdysons	2012-03-09T23:00:00Z	5	What can I say about the apple i phone 4s...brilliant brilliant! But if it goes wrong then phone apple, I wouldn't say that about many companies but they have truly an outstanding service team that can fix your phone. I upgraded the operating system on my new phone and it kept crashing. So I called Apple and they fixed it there and then.Brilliant service thanks:-)

They treat you with disdain if you happen to point that out to them.  I HAVE TAKEN MY MALFUNCTIONING PAD TO THEM THREE TIMES AND THEY REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS A PROBLEM. Many of my friends and family,that by the way are very computer literate, have seen its malfunctions....  I just end up not relying on it and using it.  Its very clubby and if you are not in the club......One question:  If you are having trouble connecting to the internet and you want help ,guess what??? you have to be connected to the internet!!! Oh yeah you can call but where is the number???  God forbid you give a manual either internally or physically .  This is just for the followers and I am not that kind of consumer.

cie_B	Dan	2012-03-02T23:00:00Z	5	Well I've been a customer for over 10+ years now, and in all that time they have never failed me.  Obviously the products are simply amazing, from iPhones to computers and although seemingly expensive in the long term I think they work out far far cheaper than PCs.   All my macs are still running perfectly, even my first G4, and don't get me wrong I've had the occasional problem with a laptop lead failing, or faulty drive etc, but I've had far less downtime and hassle running my Macs in 10 years, than the hell I used to go through with PCs.  Testament to this is how many of my friends and family have now moved over to Apple, probably helped a little by me.Whether you're shopping online or in one of their stores the experience is nothing but exceptional.  They have the best customer service in the business, whatever your question no matter how big or small it may be they just want to help you.  Go into a store and they'll greet you, and then let you be until you want help.  There is absolutely no sales pressure, they are simply there to help and answer your questions.  In fact if you just want to go in and check your emails or facebook then that is no problem either as I did many a time when i went to the US. Can't fault Apple in any which way, Steve Jobs has built the best products and software, and it was certainly a sad day to wave goodbye to him last year.  Yes I am an Apple Fanboy, but once you've used an Apple product how can you not be!
cie_B	Jan Pedersen	2012-02-29T23:00:00Z	5	I literally love the products at apple. Ipod, Iphone and macbook. These are my strongest tools in my everyday. And the design of these products... Just brilliant

cie_B	Alex O	2012-02-27T23:00:00Z	2	I have been a long-time apple product user, but am horrified to learn about the recent abuses in Chinese factories. We already pay a lot of money for these products - can't a few cents be spent to provide workers with appropriate and live-saving masks, gloves and other protective gear? It's morally disgusting how little companies value precious human lives, and how much they embrace the bottom line. I would rather switch to a company that I know values PEOPLE, regardless of where they are producers or consumers.

cie_B	Suzie Savage	2012-02-26T23:00:00Z	3	Fab products but just too pricey - Apple need to include those of us who invested originally by offering incentives to stay with them - the iphones are getting ridiculous in price!

cie_B	Martyn McCormack	2012-02-24T23:00:00Z	5	Apple is one of the greatest companies in the world and has incredible products, many of which I am privileged to own. Their web site is amazing and they do make every effort to satisfy a very discerning and probably highly critical customer base, but generally get it right!My only criticism of Apple is that they could improve their accessibility for customer inquires, so that people do not incur costs. The recent recall of the first generation ipad nano could have been handled more efficently, but it was a massive undertaking and one in which they appear to have completed to the satisfaction of many, including myself.

I have a MacBook, an iMac and an iPad and they all work together seamlessly through iCloud. The quality of the hardware is also stunning.I will never us a Windoze based machine again.
cie_B	Peter Andre	2012-02-23T23:00:00Z	5	I can’t believe how good Apples customer service is..!  I just called them regarding a problem with my old apple phone and they were really helpful. They told me how to fix the problem and they said they would also e-mail me a list of pointers so to make sure I don’t mess up the re-installation.I really enjoy using my Ipad2 it seems so slick and easy to use not like a Pc… although Pc’s have their uses. I’ve also purchased the IPhone 4s which is something else. Thanks Apple for your support and thanks for such great usable products.Petex
cie_B	Kim	2012-02-23T23:00:00Z	5	You could not PAY me to go back to a PC! The MAC computers are wonderful and I love my iphone. Ordering online is extremely easy, the shipments are quick, and the in-store service is unbeatable. I also like being able to schedule appointments online.

cie_B	William Cody Winter	2012-02-23T23:00:00Z	5	I have quite a few Apple products;A second-hand 2006 20” white iMac with a Magic Mouse,A new 27” Mid 2011 i7 iMac.A fifth gen iPod Nano.And they are all of superior quality.
cie_B	David, Chester	2012-02-20T23:00:00Z	5	I've just bought a MacBook Air and couldn't be more pleased with it. But what makes it outstanding is Apple's customer service - whether by phone or by visiting an Apple Store, the team's enthusiasm and knowledge is infectious. I'm not up to speed with technology - too old for that - but I feel comfortable with the MacBook Air. And I never thought I'd ever say that about a laptop!
cie_B	Mrs Izzard	2012-02-19T23:00:00Z	5	I have 7 Apple products and I can not recommend them highly enough!! From enquiring about a product to purchasing and then the fantastic after care!! I have never had a bad experience with dealing with Apple, they have always gone over and above my expectations!! Excellect customer service proves you get repeat customers every time!! Keep up the good work
cie_B	Red Beard	2012-02-16T23:00:00Z	5	What can I say that no one else on the planet hasn't said about Apple? Nothing. So I won't even try.
cie_B	Richard Taylor	2012-02-16T23:00:00Z	5	I purchased an original iPad a couple of months ago for my 4 year old son, specially getting the Apple cover to help protect it, but less than a week later he accidentally dropped it on the floor in the kitchen, smashing the screen. I took it to the Apple store, who were exceptionally helpful, and went above and beyond all expectations, and replaced the iPad free of charge! I purchased a much better more robust leather cover to ensure no repeat damage!Absolutely amazing customer service, other companies could learn a lot from Apple!
cie_B	T. Drury	2012-02-16T23:00:00Z	5	Apple backs all of their products and I will never switch back. I have an Apple computer, iPad, iPod and an iPhone...I LOVE Apple products and the customer service that comes with the products!!

cie_B	Michael Todd Koren	2012-02-14T23:00:00Z	5	Apple is a company that seems unafraid to take colossal risks and do what all others say will fail.  Just because they seem to know otherwise.  They set the trends, set the bar high and achieve even higher.  Everyone tries to copy them, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. But this is a testament to how revered and admired this company is.  Even in labor and assembly. The only technology company outsourcing to China that is creating some level of transparency and setting standards higher than the people in China are accustomed to, and certainly higher than their competition, no matter what the headlines try to say in order to get your attention.  They may be a little late to getting their products environmentally responsible, but again, true top Apple, they pushed the standards high and have achieved amazing results!  Some techies may feel like Apple doesn't relate to them.  That's okay - this company has certainly captured MY heart!They've also captured my pocket book.  MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone, 100's of Apps.  And somehow I want to buy more.  Say I drank the Kool-Aid!  Say what you want.   I love working with high quality tools.  These are no exceptions!
cie_B	marcelito2	2012-02-13T23:00:00Z	3	I am not always amazed by their products, but they are good in marketing
cie_B	bosica	2012-02-13T23:00:00Z	4	I'm enjoying apple products such as ipod and ipad2, and what makes apple products stand out, is that they are like Nintendo, they always invent something new, and try to improve things which is good for the consumers. I was considering and android tablet, and while I think that androd phone is better than iphone, for a tablet in every days use, ipad 2 is a must have, cause it's interface and app optimisation is what's make it better than android. Plus the apps are dirt cheap.What I dislike about apple is that they lack support for older devices, thus forcing you to buy their new products, and you also need additional hardware for connectivity.
cie_B	Phil	2012-02-12T23:00:00Z	3	Up until recent years Apple we the No.1 company for fast reliable computers. Since the release of the iPod and iPhone apple have gone down hill. They have broke into a mass market that has made their product fashionable and their quality unreliable.
cie_B	S Mosley	2012-02-12T23:00:00Z	5	I've owned Apple products for years now, I have 2 mac minis, a mac server 2 Macbook pro's, iPhone, iPad, iPod. the whole nine yards and can say I have never had anything to say against either the products or the company.Yes they are more expensive than the regular plastic PC's and laptops in the store but when you buy an Apple you invest in the knowledge that it will work every day.  When you buy one of the others you expect to put it in the bin in 12 months because you've spent half your life waiting for some customer support to tell you why it won't start or why it keeps crashing.If you buy an Apple computer you only buy it once if you buy something else it will break more times than it works, and if all you  have against it is the fact it is updated every year remember, thats progress if Apple didn't update its products every year and keeps its customers happy you would call it a PC or worse still it would be called Windows!
cie_B	James K Darling	2012-02-12T23:00:00Z	4	Given they're the manufacturer the delivery could be quicker...
cie_B	Martin Witte Svendsen	2012-02-11T23:00:00Z	2	too expensive, but i like the design, and the software, but not the App Store, with only aproved apss from you...
cie_B	Roslyn	2012-02-11T23:00:00Z	5	I have 4 different ipods and they are all awsome. I love the ipod touch.
cie_B	Bruno Bloch	2012-02-11T23:00:00Z	5	Their products are not only beautiful but they just work without any hassle. You get done whatever you need to do without having to deal with issues of the device or software itselfe like with many competing products.
cie_B	Richard	2012-02-10T23:00:00Z	2	"No one can really find too much wrong with the products - BUT - employing 500,000+ Foxconn workers in near slavery conditions makes Apple products the equivalent of ""blood diamonds"""

cie_B	Matthew	2012-02-09T23:00:00Z	2	i like my iphone. the company isn't really doing much for me though. i buy an overpriced smart phone and 12 months later they come out with something just a tad bit better. c'mon! they're doing this on purpose to get me to buy something new every year. screw that. also, i want a job... and they aren't hiring.
cie_B	Pia Sørensen	2012-02-09T23:00:00Z	4	I am the biggest Apple fan in the world. I am the proud owner of 3 Apple computers and i love them all equally. I love the design, the organic user friendly interface and the never ending stream of new features. I would love to give Apple 5 stars, but i don't think that they have innovated their hardware design, as much as I would like to see lately. Please Apple, WOW me with some great design and I will be happy to add a 5th star :-)
cie_B	Dr K	2012-02-08T23:00:00Z	5	Such cool products at prices that can't be beat. Apple TV is a great little box that does so much. iMac is even cooler.
cie_B	kiandra99	2012-02-06T23:00:00Z	4	The iphone and  ipad keep up the reputation with my customers that my taxi is my mobile office. Very reliable very easy yo use. Always high quality sound and vision. Siri helps me with my spelling.
cie_B	Othello	2012-02-06T23:00:00Z	3	They make a good product, but WAYYYY too expensive. Overpriced is what they really are!!!!

cie_B	Alex Bee	2012-01-31T23:00:00Z	1	Awful customer service, ridiculously bad, flmsy products and very definitely will never use them or buy anything from them again. Ever.
cie_B	Barbra	2012-01-31T23:00:00Z	3	Apple is indeed one of the best companies out there today, and their products are amazing, but their customer service strategy could use a bit more flexibility... and they could also lower their prices every now and then, like their competitors do

cie_B	Russell David	2012-01-30T23:00:00Z	5	Ive bought most of the apple products I own in-store and iphone was from Orange,  but I have bought many accessories from apple store,  including speaker docs, covers,  cables and most recently a watch strap which is for the new nano which doubles up as a watch when your not playing music through it on a run or whilst in the gym  and also a Radio Alarmclock speaker doc for an Ipad and other apple devices. The apple store itself is easy to use and you can checkout quickly using your apple ID, so its as fast as downloading apps or music from the app store or itunes.  Delivery arrived on the date specified on the store itself which was about 10 days later (just in time for Xmas)
cie_B	Martin	2012-01-29T23:00:00Z	5	Great company, great quality and great products, recommend to all!
cie_B	Patrick Hartge	2012-01-29T23:00:00Z	1	"Everything you buy from Apple is overrated, highly priced and poor quality and by that I mean very low quality hardware. Just google any pc versus mac hardware/price comparison and maybe you'll learn something. I build computers for people everyday, and Gaming computer with windows costs about $1,300. The same computer, but ordered from macs website, costs about $8,500. There is no reason, there is no ""added programs that windows doesn't have that make it worth it."" Anything mac can do, pc can do better and with more variety and that's just fact. Anyone who says differently are biased fanboys. However, my wife wanted to have an IPAD like the rest of her friends, so I ordered one straight from the website. I received the item a few days short of 4 weeks after ordering it, with no customer service responding to why it was taking so long, in a box with no padding. As in they mailed the Ipad (in its packaging) in a box 10x the size of it, without anything to stop it from bouncing around. Sure enough it was broken. What did Apple customer support say? They said, AND I quote ""You probably received a week ago, dont know how to take care of your items and broke it yourself, therefore since we have no proof it was our fault, we will not replace it.""That was $600~ dollars wasted. It's been 5 weeks now and I'm still trying to get my money back."
cie_B	Customer	2012-01-28T23:00:00Z	5	I can't believe how unbelievable apple are, they are the future and they are the best products I have ever had :) if your going electrical, go apple! <3

cie_B	George Bryans	2012-01-27T23:00:00Z	4	The quality of the laptops is amazing down to every last detail. However, you have to have the disposable income to be able to afford one and they seem to die or get problems after a year and a half or so
cie_B	John Rudkin	2012-01-26T23:00:00Z	5	"If you want anything to do with Apple, go to the core. Or should that be ""the store"".  Simply wonderful user experience from the kings of cool."

cie_B	Liz Williams	2012-01-23T23:00:00Z	5	No one would have believed in the last years of the twentieth century that apple were using intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as our own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were envisaging hand held devices with infinite complexity.  Men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to App Store or iTunes, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there were other computer programs inferior to apple's and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf the Atlantic, minds immeasurably superior to ours, regarded these computers with piteous eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans to help us. And early in the twentyfirst century came the Iphone, Thank you Apple
cie_B	Customer Stuart	2012-01-23T23:00:00Z	5	New iphone recieved swiftly, as always with apple everything is quality even down to the minimilast well designed packaging.

cie_B	martin stubbs	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	Not only do they offer great products but the support that comes with it is outstanding. It gives you confidence in buying such products knowing that they are always there to help and offer support long after the sale.Other retailers should follow suit as their customer service can not be beaten
cie_B	Paul	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	Bought a Canon HD Video Camera 2 years ago and it has been a great buy.  Apple Store Online were very helpful and they only sell top quality goods
cie_B	JLow	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	4	Fantastic products but the prices are a bit silly.
cie_B	Sparx	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	4	The website it quite messy, it's not easy to find specific things, and when you do theres another 4 screens before you can purchase
cie_B	Sharon Loken	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	Not in my book ...  can anything beat a ma!!!  .  I am self taught and would never consider anything other than a mac.  It is user friendly.  The help is great.  I have had 2 i-macs and each one gets better.  I have the new large screen one now.  I truly love the mac comcept.  Anyone can buy a mac,  and learn to operate it with a few lessons.  I give a i-mac a 10 on a scale of 1 - 5.
cie_B	Linda	2012-01-18T23:00:00Z	5	I started using Apple products in the 80's....and have never looked back...user friendly....innovative....does things like no other!  LOVE APPLE!  Customer service is incredible!

cie_B	Michael Hetherington	2012-01-18T23:00:00Z	5	I have had my MacBook for a year and had no problems what so ever - I know tempting fate here. But with previous laptops the speed had noticeably gone after 6 months but not with the MacBook Pro.  I have iPods and just acquired an iPhone 4S after upgrading my 3GS.  What can I say - Apple is so much more stable and reliable!!
cie_B	Iulia Kolesnicov	2012-01-17T23:00:00Z	5	I had apple computers, and now other devices, since the '90s and I never had problems with them, I replaced all my computers just because I wanted a new one, not because it stopped working. I am extremely happy with this brand!
cie_B	Vesile Halil	2012-01-17T23:00:00Z	1	I have had a disastrous experience recently with my purchase through Apple.com! My Imac disappeared on the way and despite paying so much money I have had to wait long time for Apple to send a replacement. Not the best position to be in when you desperately need a computer. Bottom line- they are paired with dodgy couriers and Customer services take their time to reply and process your requests.I received my computer after about two weeks of phoning and asking. Now I am again phoning because the product is faulty...just can't believe it! And the reason I went on, paid much money and bought Apple on the first place was to have something with a high quality!Not to mention that am angry to be paying for all the phone calls and waiting on the queue to get to speak to an adviser!I have asked for a compensation for all the troubles....but guess what...the customer adviser I have been in touch with very conveniently stopped replying to my e-mails! Although we have agreed to keep in touch and she promised when I get my purchase they would compensate me for the inconvenience!Well...I AM NOT AMAZED APPLE.COM! Very very disappointed and will speak it up every time I get the chance!
cie_B	Mrs. Love	2012-01-17T23:00:00Z	5	Best company EVER.

cie_B	Derek	2012-01-13T23:00:00Z	5	Eventually I'm going to buy something from the site, but it is easy to navigate and gives the meat and potatoes when looking at main points for buying things from Apple.

cie_B	James Stephens	2012-01-12T23:00:00Z	2	Lovely design of hardware, but what does Apple think they're playing at with iTunes?  It's not even as good as Windows Media Player!Come on Apple, stop being so arrogant and let us load our iPods from a media player of our choice.  Oh, and while I mentioning arrogance, let me mention pure stubbornness... when are you going to use Flash Player on your devices?  Until you do, I won't be replacing my iPod or buying an iPad or iPhone.

cie_B	Richard	2012-01-08T23:00:00Z	1	Apple you need to make things more compatible with other softwares otherwise you will lose customers. your phones, ipads and other devices have no slots memory, can't change batteries and you live has to go through itunes (what is you want to add a file in a internet cafe or friends house, no can doo). plus can't watch flash videos.Good build but can see this company go down hill (hopefully!).
cie_B	Jeffrey Hunter	2012-01-08T23:00:00Z	5	"The ""on"" button is not the ""be on five minutes from now"" button. I understand the error messages I (basically never) read. And the shit is simple -- timeless -- classy.Everything just works. No Apple product ever slows me down."
cie_B	Roger	2012-01-08T23:00:00Z	5	I've been a loyal mac user since my Apple 2E and original 4/40 powerbook days.  Work dictated one venture to the dark side of PC-world, that lasted only one month, before gladly coming back home to mac.  There's nothing like a mac, and nothing like Apple.  Keep up the great work!
cie_B	Kevin Thompson	2012-01-06T23:00:00Z	4	My family are very big Apple fans and have most things Apple including MacBooks, Itouches, Ipads and Iphones. The build quality used to be very good but as they get bigger and bigger this seems to be slipping. Wether this is because they are using cheaper components, this is why I have given them 4 stars. Everything else we cannot fault. The retail shop is very handy if you want to try any of their products or need advise. Also if you have a problem you can book a Genius Bar appointment that is in the shop and get it sorted. Staff are very helpful and take time to explain things. Shops can get very busy and noisy with kids playing on things.

cie_B	Jeremy	2012-01-02T23:00:00Z	5	Apple are the best. Their products, packaging and customer service make the stand out. A shining example of a great American company.
cie_B	Michael	2012-01-01T23:00:00Z	4	The only problem is that I can't afford most of the technology that they're selling. I don't own an Apple product, but when I've used one, they never cease to amaze me.
cie_B	Tim Mace	2011-12-29T23:00:00Z	3	I am a true Apple fanboy and the products get better and better. I have had Apple products for the last 15 years using every OS since OS 8.Support is great, especially since the advent of the Apple Retail Stores where I can book a slot at the genius bar and get my problem sorted in store most of the time.However the only reason for the three star rating and not five is that the products build quality is decreasing rapidly. This year I have had 25 iMac's scratching optical discs, Three iPad's with faulty sound, Two iPad 2's with faults, 7 MacBook chargers fail, 18 HDD failures and an iPod touch with a flickery screen. I manage three schools Mac networks to a total of 130 Apple desktops and three servers. The removal of the xServe and the simplifying of OS X server has seriously knocked my confidence in Apple as a company.I only hope Tim Cook can rescue the state of the company before it's too late and it goes entirely OS devices only.
cie_B	Robert Smith	2011-12-28T23:00:00Z	4	I found the new Ipads were a little lacking on example apps but I guess that is up to the customer to buy once they get it home.Staff were friendly and helpful in general.
cie_B	Matt Church	2011-12-28T23:00:00Z	5	I'm not going to comment on the actual apple products, as they are often either loved or hated.However their site offers a great experience. The student discount is a massive 15% off and a great warranty deal.The company comes into its own though in its customer service. Any problems with an apple device can be solved by calling the company or visiting a Genius Bar at a local apple store. They are always helpful and often offer free replacements for issues with the device if it is in warranty.

cie_B	Kelv	2011-12-20T23:00:00Z	2	I expected faster shipping and service from the high-tech innovative giant that is apple. They are suppose to be the best? Their supply chain is lacking. I haven't gotten my product until weeks later. Their products are definitely not user friendly. If it were, I would have gotten my music straight into this shuffle without having to restore it 5 times first. I expected better from the world-leading innovative tech company.

cie_B	Robin Patin	2011-12-14T23:00:00Z	2	"I don't know if I cheesed off Steve Jobs in a former life or something, but I have received the worst customer service from Apple.I want to like Apple. I really do. I even considered getting a Mac Book to replace my aging PC. But I can't bring myself to overlook the crappy customer service I have received from Apple.Case in point - I had a first generation IPod. I received an email that there was a defect in the battery and that Apple was replacing all first generation IPods. I found my IPod and contacted Apple. They said that they were sending me a box and I simply ship it back to Apple and I'd get a replacement within a few weeks. During that time, I had a few additional questions. Contacting Apple via phone was a nightmare and I spent a long time trying to get the right person. When I finally did get someone, they said that I had been included in the replacement program in error and that I should toss out the replacement box and NOT send my IPod in.WTF?!?I had wasted time and energy on this mess and all they could say was that this was a mistake on Apple's part?!? They were apologetic, but they were somewhat snarky about the whole matter. They agreed to allow me to talk to a manager for further explanation. Then they put me on hold. At the five minute on hold mark, I said, ""you know, life is short. I've wasted enough of my life on this mess"" and hung up.I tossed out the box. Despite the glowing customer service my friends have gotten from Apple, I don't really have much good to say about my experiences with them. I must admit that Apple has great design and everyone raves about the Mac, but Apple won't be getting my hard earned dollars. They had a chance to make a customer for life and they blew it."

cie_B	Justin Vogt	2011-12-08T23:00:00Z	1	My iPhone 3Gs stopped working after 11 months of use.  I called the apple tech support where they charge $30 to help make sure its not a simple problem.  I hesitantly obliged knowing it wasnt a simple issue and figuring I wouldnt be charged when they found this to be true. Tech support has you hold down a couple buttons at the same time (which I already tried 20+ times myself.) This did not remedy the issue and I was told I would have to apply for a refund of the $30 since it was a problem w/ their product. I told her I didnt want to apply for a refund, I just wanted her to cancel the transaction then and there. She said she would, and yet the charge is still on my statement.  I wish this is where my complaint ends but it's far from over. The technician told me there were a few ways to replace the phone, most cost more money and time without a phone. I chose to go into a apple store so they could replace it for me free of charge. Of course they set an appt. for you not knowing if the store even has the product on hand. I asked if she could find out ahead of time to save me time and gas. She told me she could not dial out from her office and that I would have to call on my own. After spending $30 for absolutely zero help, this really pissed me off. So I took a deep breath and hung up w/ her and called the store. After a 15 minute wait on hold a representitve answered only to tell me they can't look up what products they have in stock and I'd just have to come in and hope it worked out. If they didnt, they could send me to another store or order one for me. This is the MOST rediculous thing I have ever heard! I don't have a working vehicle at the moment and this is a HUGE inconvenience to me! Not one bit of descent customer service in my whole experience. I am appauled and disappointed. Shame on them!

cie_B	Steve Cunio	2011-12-06T23:00:00Z	5	I have not fallen out of love with my Mac since buying it to replace Windows systems that slowed my hardware down to a crawl.  Only quibble is I wished they used Royal Mail for deliveries as the courier depot is a bit of a trek away. Great products that will stand the test of time.

cie_B	Ramon Cremers	2011-12-01T23:00:00Z	5	Apple is a very good company ( as all of you probably already know ). The prices might seem a bit of high, but the hardware in all of their devices are extremely good, and so is their software. If you are looking for a new phone, laptop, tablet etc I would advice you to spend some extra money and get an Apple product. you won't regret it.

cie_B	Nathaniel	2011-11-29T23:00:00Z	1	In no way would £1000 leave my wallet for a computer I can buy for £300. Yes Mac OS X is much more reliable, responsive and highly featured than Windows. But considering I use neither operating system, the price tag is absurd.Also, which manufacturer in their right minds would prevent a standard human interface device such as a keyboard working on a computer simply because the OS is two sub-revisions too old.Ridiculous!
cie_B	Nicole	2011-11-29T23:00:00Z	5	products, service, style. All amazing.

cie_B	Andrew Rideout	2011-11-29T23:00:00Z	4	Quality is not always 100% (cables etc break frequently and are expensive to replace), but their customer service and warrantee is what keeps me coming back as a customer - if it wasn't for that I would certainly shop elsewhere, but you can be confident of good support from Apple - particularly if you are able to access an Apple Store.

So I order the 13"" Macbook Air, 256MB flash drive, Thunderbolt display, Apple extreme base station, Apple care, One on one, the works - over $3000 in products, I filled out the online app only to find out that Apples partner, Barclays, system is down. They can't honor Apples stated financing offer on Apples website - I am PO'd, disapointed and mad as hell!"

cie_B	Customer	2011-11-21T23:00:00Z	4	Apple seems to have great customer service. Just the price of some items need to be adjusted based on Exchange Rate, especially when compared to Dollar prices for the US
cie_B	Zealous Web	2011-11-21T23:00:00Z	4	Definitely great vision by its founders. Took over the world of tech by surprise when it was launched. Users always expect innovative creations, only a little issue generally related is its price, other than which its great.

cie_B	Rita Simmonds	2011-11-15T23:00:00Z	1	I recently became an Apple user by buying an IMac and upgrading to an IPad and IPhone combo from Best Buy/Car Phone Warehouse.  All seemed well until I had to register my products and upgrade the operating system on the IMac because the mail app wouldn't work with the email address they had given me as it wasn't ICloud friendly.  First the Apple on-line software wouldn't recognise my IMAC or IPAD serial numbers and all the staff could say was it was it was a known problem so I was told I would need to upload my receipt, then the system would not accept either a scan or photo of the receipt and there was no other way of going forward which was most annoying. After a number of time consuming back and forth conversations with Apple care staff and many frustrated attempts to register on my part I had to take the computer back to the store so they could try to resolve the problems.  They didn't have any more success than me so in the end they had to take my new IMAC back, transfer all of my data across to another new system and give me the new Imac. I am a small business user and I found it to be a very frustrating experience that cost me a week I could ill afford, add to that the fact that Apple seem to think you don't need manuals for any of their equipment so you have to work everything out for yourself and the mail app doest actually retrieve emails but only downloads copies so you need a means of clearing your mailboxes on-line and there would appear to be no Apple applications like Mail washer to do that its been a very frustrating experience and one I am beginning to regret so all in all I am not at all impressed. Its a shame as the Ipad and the Iphone are really nice but this experience has really soured things for me Apple needs to do something about that if that want more people to come over from Windows.  In the meantime I am left still using my old Windows laptop to do mailbox house keeping, manage my email accounts and create patterns in CoralDraw as it looks like the Mac just isnt up to taking either job in a cost effective and efficient manner what a shame
cie_B	samc	2011-11-12T23:00:00Z	5	Very efficiant website, alots of ways can find what i want. Giving me huge amounts of information of the product. this making me want to buy the product even more as its very easy, and quick to use. Recomend it to anyone !
cie_B	Sarah Dawson	2011-11-11T23:00:00Z	5	Everything I have that is Apple just works. They bring products out that are only of the very highest standard and their designs are simply fantastic.

cie_B	Nessie	2011-11-04T23:00:00Z	3	I love my Mac.  Even though its a few years old now, its my lifeline to the world.  I love that I don't get the faff of viruses that PC users have, that the technology is reliable, and easy to use.I am slightly disappointed that Apple don't have their customer services sorted though, its the only thing that keeps them from 5 stars.
cie_B	Thomas Ebdrup	2011-11-03T23:00:00Z	4	I have an Iphone 3GS and a Ipad2 and both of them have given me several hours of joy, even now I write this from my Ipad...But to be frank the iphone 3GS has a very bad microphone compared to other mobiles... And offcourse it would have been nice with flash on the ipad... But both are still great products
cie_B	Paul	2011-11-02T23:00:00Z	4	Bought an apple TV (its great) and a few accessories recently. I found the checkout hard work since I was entering a different delivery address and wanted to choose a different payment method to my default iTunes credit card. I got there in the end but it was not very slick.Goods were delivered next day though, well packed etc, so overall a good shopping experience.
cie_B	Mark Robinson	2011-10-29T22:00:00Z	4	but so far it is their price that restricts my opportunity to enjoy them more. but when my economy is no longer what it is then my computer will change too
cie_B	Karl Seidel	2011-10-28T22:00:00Z	5	OK - call me an Apple Fanboy! At this point I don't care...I used to think calling me a boy or a fan was not something I'd embrace.Apple has changed my mind and my attitude - it makes me happy to use any Apple product - hardware, software, apps, etc. I recently bought another iPad for work - and I momentarily considered using amazon.com for the purchase - to save the cost of tax/shipping - and I love and buy stuff from amazon constantly. But I think the direct path is always the best way to go - so I paid a little more for the Apple.com experience. Call me a sucker - if you knew me you'd know unlikely it is I'd rave about anything - unless it was incredible. That's the effect apple.com has on me - go figure.
cie_B	Øystein Jakobsen	2011-10-25T22:00:00Z	1	Having rounded corners and white/aluminium surface don't make you less evil. Super proprietary, controlling and cencoring, neverending lawsuits, lobbying and child labour are just 'some* headlines of this horrible, horrible company.Remember - it is you - the customer - that fund these guys, you can't turn away from your responsibility. Ignorance is no defence either, the information is there if you wish to look beneath the glossy veneer.
cie_B	Graham Scott	2011-10-24T22:00:00Z	5	Iphone 4 was out of warrenty but they still replaced without question. Best customer service i've ever experienced. Dont think ill have another make of phone in my life.
cie_B	Rebekah	2011-10-23T22:00:00Z	1	Grand Rapids Michigan Apple Store.Worst customer service from Michael Zeerpoort . Not helpful & was unwilling resolve issues without charging $$ on brand new product not even a wk old.  Tried to compare an Iphone to a car.  he doesn't know the car world very well or he would know by law a bumper has to with stand everyday use of 10 mph damage or the manufacturer has to re-place it.  Just like a phone its expected to be dropped, not from 20 feet but everyday use it needs to with stand.  He wouldn't replace a iphone that fell apart after being dropped out of a diaper bag. 1st time being dropped phone was not even a wk old.

cie_B	J	2011-09-21T22:00:00Z	3	Whilst I have several iPods and iPhones within the household, I have always had to buy them when they were out of season or 2 generations old... now that other companies are catching up and even exceeding Apple capabilities and style, I am tempted to cross over if Apple's prices don't plateau into something affordable...
cie_B	vincent	2011-09-20T22:00:00Z	5	a very good company very relaible
cie_B	Phil Crabill	2011-09-16T22:00:00Z	5	I have been using Apple since 1981! There products are great. I love my iMac and my iPod.

cie_B	Matt Parker	2011-09-01T22:00:00Z	2	I've been a fan of Apple for a long time but recent experiences have changed that. I've had a couple of warranty items that they have tried their hardest to not cover - only after I;ve argued my point for a long time will they admit that their product is faulty and covered under warranty.

cie_B	Mark Harrison	2011-06-22T22:00:00Z	5	I have never ordered online because I prefer going into the store.  I love the fact that the staff are happy to let you mess around with their products and don't pressure you with sales tactics.  Infact, I liked it when I tried to purchase my first mac after only ever using windows, the staff wanted to make sure I really wanted a mac and wasn't rushing into it.  The staff seemed passionate and talked me through how to use MacOS.  I then purchased my mac and am very happy with it.  I can't walk past an Apple shop without wanting to have a play around with stuff!
cie_B	Kieran Wright	2011-06-21T22:00:00Z	4	Yes, Apple make beautiful products, but anyone in their right mind can see that they're at least double the price that they should be.I was disenchanted with Windows so moved to Apple. It's the old old story. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Apple is the best thing since sliced bread, because it isn't. And shock, horror, Apple products do have problems. Admittedly not even a 100th of the problems Windows have, but they do have problems.My advice to anyone would be, before paying for an operating system, have a look at Linux. You may be pleasantly surprised, not only at the interface, but also the price. It's free!
cie_B	Paul	2011-06-13T22:00:00Z	5	I have owned a Mac since 1997 and never looked back.Excellent range of products, well designed and work fantasticly well and so far ahead of there rivals.I order online most of the time. Not problems, staff are always very pleasant and helpful if I need to contact them.Apple are the No 1 company on the planet.
cie_B	Anthony	2011-05-31T22:00:00Z	5	If there is anything electronic that I need in my life and apple does it, I'll get it. Their products are without peers in design and functionality, and the best part is the massive support system for customers on their products, even allowing other users of their products offer advice along with their own, it takes a special company to pull this off and apple kicks everything into touch.
cie_B	Danny	2011-05-30T22:00:00Z	5	Apple is one of the best e-companies I bought lots of devices from, Ipad is amazing! Highly recommended!
cie_B	PDWM	2011-05-04T22:00:00Z	5	Down the years I have bought Apple products and services. They really are second to none. On the rare occasion when something goes wrong their support have stayed with me (phoning me back) until the problem was sorted. I know that some people think that Apple are pricey, but I really value my time and sanity, so in my opinion worth every penny.This is in stark contrast to some of my friends who have bought, shall we say, other cheaper products.
cie_B	Darran	2011-04-03T22:00:00Z	4	Apple are one of the best electronic companies around, IPhone 4 is amazing! would recommend!
cie_B	Andy Smith	2011-03-20T23:00:00Z	5	My iphone 4 broke and I took this to the Apple store in Sheffield.  They were absolutely brilliant and gave me a straight replacement no questions asked.  Super helpful, I ended up buying a MacBook Pro!
cie_B	Arch Maca	2011-03-02T23:00:00Z	3	I bought the Ipod shiffle to use in the gym as it was small and compact with easy controls.  There is a problem with the headphone control button which has failed on two headphones now.  I had one pair replaced within the warranty period, but they lasted 2 months.  This was a known issue and should have been rectified by Apple, but customers have to prove the goods are within warranty, despite having recorded the serial number with Apple.
cie_B	Westerdijk	2010-11-18T23:00:00Z	5	Ordered the Magic Mouse & Trackpad from their webshop. Fast and accurate delivery as to be expected from Apple.
cie_B	James Darronte	2010-10-25T22:00:00Z	4	Got an Apple TV and very satisfied with it. Just wish they would open themselves more to embrace other technologies being compatible with their products. Other than that, you can't go wrong with Apple thats for sure.
cie_B	Michael	2010-07-10T22:00:00Z	5	Great site, I now have my iMac
cie_B	Jurome Azotize	2010-06-08T22:00:00Z	4	"The site is easy to navigate, pretty to look at, and easy to shop on.  They are a bit pricey though — it would be nice to see Apple have a ""sale"" which I have yet to see — kind of arrogant if you ask me.  But alas, people will pay the prices.  I'd like to say I wouldn't... or haven't... on a regular basis.  Wish they had information on past Apple products, like a redirect page to information about it or something.  Don't think about buying a power cable for your old Cinema Display (pre-Mini Display Port-era), because you won't find it."
cie_B	Christofer SWE	2010-06-01T22:00:00Z	5	Fast delivery and very good product!I will order again and again!
cie_B	Robert Wilson	2010-04-13T22:00:00Z	3	Normally I am pleased with Apple as they generally delivery within a week and the quality is top notch but on this occasion i had to wait 2 weeks for my order which apparently was in stock, not particularly good in this day and age.When i finally received this there was a lose screw rattling around in the tower which unfortunately i cannot get to, pretty shoddy considering i paid over £2000 for this item, where is the QC checks Apple?On the plus side the customer service is very good, they are very keen to look after you if there is a problem, so at least there is some redemption on this occasion.
cie_B	Jack	2010-03-25T23:00:00Z	5	I bought a Macbook Pro. It took just 7 days from it to be built, made in shanghai china and shipped to London! Superb service, kept me up to date and a superb hotline with friendly and funny staff at the other end of the phone. Faultless service!!
cie_B	Darren Cowasaki	2010-03-24T23:00:00Z	5	Always had great service.  Delivery speed ok.  Any faults and they have been fixed very well.  All in all very good service and will continue to use them
cie_B	MRAde	2010-02-17T23:00:00Z	5	I find this site so useful for the latest films. It has brought to my attention so many documentary films that I might otherwise have missed. Can't fault it at all.

All you get on the site is a sales pitch under all categories, or some premium rate number, the after sales serviice is rubbish.

Meaning - Apple will not tell you that after three repairs with same issue, they normally replace your laptop/ipod/etc or that you can get erronous hardware exchanged. I ALWAYS get competent help from Apple (I call the US or UK / Ireland service for competent supporters; the scandinavian support is crap and can rarely tell you anything that is not in the knowledge base. But generally pleased and happy with apple - a lot better dealing directly with them than for example humac in Denmark
