cie_A	Ozzie	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I had placed an order via the google store and was told that i had 2 verify my identity in order to prevent fraud and my order would be placed. I emailed on many occasions and got no response. When calling the customer service they do not know what they are talking about they keep putting you on hold and say they are chatting with their department via chat mail. How unprofessional? Basically they did not send my items they did not deal with my queries to be honest it seams like a scam and fraud to get peoples personal details and identity. DO NOT USE GOOGLE STORE IT IS NOT SAFE

cie_A	Conor Dunne	2018-08-27T22:00:00Z	5	I have used a number of different search engines in the past: Microsoft Edge, Bing etc.Out of the ones I have used, Google Chrome is the best. It’s fast, secure, easy to use and the layout is simple. Sure, there are some ads but not too many and I’m certain that Chrome has some of the best security around. Gmail is great and you can sign in to accounts on most websites with it. Best of all, it’s free. I would recommend Google Chrome and Gmail to anyone who has a computer and needs a search engine and an email address.

cie_A	Seth	2018-08-23T22:00:00Z	2	"Don't order G-Suite trial for your business!!Very dodgy business practice by Google, who are clearly not half as reputable as we had thought. I agreed to their 1 month free trial of G-suite, and after the month decided not to go with a subscription so asked to cancel.  But hidden in the small print that nobody is ever going to see without an hour of free time and a magnifying glass is a paragraph that says you are waiving all rights to free Gmail from that point on and must pay or have all your google account and domains deleted, as well as inbox, photos etc.Totally shocking!  What a deception from Google to force people to pay them every month for what is free to everyone else who didn't go for the ""free"" trial."

cie_A	Helen White	2018-08-14T22:00:00Z	3	Google themselves are ok but they will keep trying to push Chrome on you and places like TalkTalkTV make matters worse by no longer operating via Internet Explorer so you have to  use Chrome or Firefox.  I don't find Chrome any faster (it is slower actually) and five times in the last week it crashed on me while I was browsing in Windows 10.  thank god for Microsoft Edge - much better

cie_A	Harlee Desbiens	2018-08-01T22:00:00Z	1	I was charged for a subscription I cancelled over a year ago. My bank told me the money had already been taken out of my account and was no longer pending so they couldnt do anything except put through a case that would take months. I called google play who kept deflecting the issue and asked me to speak with my bank over and over. They seen charges from over a year ago, but claimed they couldnt see any recent charges. I spoke with the supervisor who was just as useless and not providing me with any solutions. Neither of them even had the days of the charges from over a year ago correct. I am so disappointed that I am going to switch everything I own over to apple. This company has the worst customer service I have ever seen, I have 10 years of call center experience with 5 years being in a supervisor role.... Absolutely disgraceful for a big company.

cie_A	chris clarkson	2018-07-30T22:00:00Z	1	My product never arrived, I contacted google support and was assured I would be put through to a specialist to deal with my support case and grant a refund or replacement. No specialist ever contacted me, I sent two chasing emails responses in reply to the original support contact email address to no reply, opened another support case referencing the previous one AND sent a Linkedin message to the EMEA customer support manager. No refund, no replacement, no further contact of any kind has been made. Frankly I expected better and unless there is some remedy I cannot recommend buying a google product to anyone.

So we have Samsung-Google and AT&T.There are some features I don’t really like, but that was not my problem.My problem began a few months after purchase.The Google that came with the phone was just fine.  Then someone “updated” my phone with Google Assistance.  Now I have two software’s  competing with each other.  This was a extremely frustrating situation, even having me considering changing phone provider and going with an IPhone.Then the day came that my Bluetooth wouldn’t (couldn’t) pair with the phone.  The Bluetooth ID had been deleted from the phone.Very bad experience with the AT&T store in Lakewood Wa to I went to the AT&T store in University Place.  Great young man – He deleted the Google system that had been forced on my – activated my BlueTooth – solved the problems that Google had been responsible for.Same thing that the EU just fined Google 5 Billion for forcing phone mfg to install.  Does anyone know of a Class Action Suit in the United States?
cie_A	karen lankester	2018-07-19T22:00:00Z	1	"Rubbish -how can you resolve an issue when you are not contactable except through this review platform? I gave a truthful but negative review of SSE for being dishonest on its quotes system on a systemic basis. I spoke to SSE & they agreed this was true & that I had provided actual not estimated readings but they still quoted my usage as 30% in excess of the actual annual usage. Since then, I have had google error messages interrupting & preventing me using google, whilst my ""identity "" is being checked & my review has been deleted from the SSE website. Hum somebody was unhappy then - I don't care if it challenges large scale dishonesty : my DD's were about to double - for no good reason. How many others are getting ripped off - that should the concern of sites like these - not hounding reviewers. SSE have verified what I have said is true you need to stop preventing me from using google."

cie_A	Cathy Conway	2018-06-25T22:00:00Z	1	I have been trying to resolve an AdWords issue for three weeks. At least 15 different customer service representatives have told me that they have 'initiated my request' or that my request is 'under process' and that they have requested the advisor to call me back. I have not received one call from the 'advisor' or any member of customer service EVER. I have had to call every single time to initiate communication and chase for updates about the status of my request, which i need to explain from scratch every single time. This makes me want to scream into a pillow. No informative answer has ever been given to me, only a vague reassurance that they are addressing my issue, but clearly this is not happening.
cie_A	MT	2018-06-19T22:00:00Z	1	Customer service is not the best but I think the issue lies more with googles policy which means their staff are working under constraints. I purchased a google pixel under 24 month warranty. A year in the phone had a serious issue (battery drain and suddenly turns of at 50 or so per cent). After testing I was adviced to send it in for a replacement as it is under warranty. Sadly googles warranty means they must replace the phone but that does not mean you will get a new phone. You get a refurbished phone. The same make and model but it is someone elses that has been repaired and given to you therefore could have been purchased before yours and have more miles on the clock. So be aware of this as this is standard procedure and happens to virtually everybody who has a faulty phone under warranty. The only rare exception may be if your phone is reasonably new (a month old) and has a fault, and even then not a given.

Like all the negative opinions, Google discreetly censors opinions and complaints in order to give only a positive image of its company and its customers (businesses for example) including on Youtube, the neutrality of the net and the freedom of expression are absent with Google unlike its advertising. Just because Google is a well-known multinational does not mean that it is blameless.

cie_A	Nirvana VrOdgo	2018-05-22T22:00:00Z	1	So I got scammed and robbed by web shop, so I started posting comments and review to let people know about the company to avoid more people falling to same trap.I purchased some items from a website claiming to sell Italian made items. I contacted the website and got written confirmation that the items will be designed, produced and shipped from Italy. So I ordered a few items.But as I found out MADE IN CHINA, PROMOTED ON THE WEBSITE, AS DESIGNED; PRODUCED AND SHIPPED FROM ITALY.When the time came to get the items I got DHL tracking number and after checking, I noticed my order is coming from HONG KONG. I contacted the company but they told me is cheaper to send from Italy to china and back which made no sense. I couldnt do a thing about that and ended up losing over 500euros. The company devised and uses legal loophole marking the item as custom. Therefore no payment protection plan is possible. They also threaten me with a lawsuit if I keep posting reviews of what they did to me.I did the only thing I could, posting reviews and comments to warn people on the internet to be careful to buy from this site. But all the reviews and comments that have connection to google such as google maps, youtube etc. even the sites that I logged in through using my google account were censored and removed without even telling me.The site that I was scammed and robbed by, must be paying google to let their site come higher in the search results. And also they must be paying them for advertising the site. Therefore making them a paying customer of google. I do not understand that google uses this kind of tactics to protect their paying customers, even if the company is cheating and stealing from people. I have tried to contact google but there is no specific way to get to the correct person to present the documentation and finding that I gathered.The company that have scammed me is freely posting fake reviews all over the internet without anyone stopping them. I urge google to contact me so I can show them that the money they are being paid with is stolen and they are supporting and promoting scammers and thieves.The Webshop in question in SPOSAMORE.COM and the related sites vestitidasposaeconomici, vestidosdenovias, matrimoniodafiaba, sposanoviaI cant a place to solve this issue anywhere and the scammer are free to continue.

They can't even honour their own promises and are an embarrassment to the people who are taken in by their false promises of protection.Shame on you Google!!

cie_A	Nicole	2018-05-13T22:00:00Z	1	Their customer service representative are all awesome. But their processes and warranty program is the worst I've ever experienced. Had nothing but issues with my pixel phone since I got it SIX months ago, do everything g they said including TWO FACTORY RESETS. Stuff is not easy to transfer from the phone, so that took a lot of time. I run a household and business out of this phone, they want me to send it there, be without a phone for at least one whole week and then they will send one back once they get it. They refuse to accept shipments through anything other than UPS which is at least ONE AND A HALF HOURS away from the closest one. My business will be going back to apple. NEVER had this issue with apple ever.
cie_A	Gareth	2018-05-11T22:00:00Z	1	Used the referral promotion on Google Pay to refer a friend so we both get £10, it didn't work, contacted their customer service who fobbed us off repeatedly saying it takes up to 28 days/etc, contacted them again after 28 days and they repeatedly ask questions that have already been answered by us kept being told we are being put through to the highest level of support but keep being told they can't do anything and they need to put us higher (they clearly don't understand how highest and higher work) eventually lied to saying that a code wasn't entered originally despite my friend having a recorded phone call saying it had been, yet they refuse to respond further
cie_A	Rick Quintana	2018-05-09T22:00:00Z	3	Regarding play.google.com, I paid for a song on Google Play on my android phone and it initially appeared in 'my music' but I was unable to download it.  After trying various things such as refreshing, I completely lost it.  Tech support couldn't resolve it other than to delete the charge, a 3-5 day process, and I'll have to wait until it is resolved before I can attempt to purchase it again.  For the money they make and the money that they pay their software engineers, it's surprising that it doesn't work much better than an average site.  It's clumsy and unreliable.
cie_A	Donna	2018-05-07T22:00:00Z	1	Google locked me out one day ago and their instructions send me in a loop. Very frustrating, I will have to open a new email with a different provider I don't ever what to deal with them again!!!

cie_A	James	2018-05-03T22:00:00Z	1	"Short version: Google Store UK support's motto should be ""Tell a giant billion dollar mega-corporation that cares."" They mucked me around for two months before finally agreeing to replace my faulty phone under warranty. Long version: I have just spent 55 days battling with Google Store UK support, attempting to have them honour my warranty claim for a faulty Pixel 1. As a buyer of Google's very expensive (and at the time) flagship phone, the way my warranty claim was handled should be seen as nothing less than an utter failure and embarrassment for Google and whoever handles their support processes. The phone was demonstrating severe battery degradation problems, to the point where from a '100%' charge (according to the phone's own battery monitoring system) it would not remain powered on in standby for longer than an hour before crashing, requiring a power cable to boot up, and then 'charge' again from a flat state. It was totally unusable on a day-to-day basis.Despite this clearly being a hardware issue, I went through the process of pulling a bug report, taking screenshots of the battery usage graph, and sending this to Google support, at their request. My assumption was that their vaunted 'engineers' would quickly discover there were no software issues (this problem was present in a factory reset state after all) and I would soon be offered a remedy under warranty. How wrong I was.Finding myself having to constantly chase up the 'progress' of their engineers with emails and phone calls, I was repeatedly fobbed off with nonsense excuses and given no details on what it was that they were actually doing to resolve my issue. The only thing I got was scripted canned responses and vague suggestions that the next Android security patch would fix the issue. Quite how a replacement battery was going to be delivered over the air was not addressed.Over the course of two months, I went through three deployments of Android patches (including the first which dropped around the time of my initial complaint, which I was asked to ensure was installed before sending my first bug report), and after each one had zero impact on the defunct status of my phone's battery, I was again told to pull a bug report and submit it to the mystical 'engineers'.At one stage, having been told in writing that a replacement device would be offered, support then rescinded the offer and told me to wait for yet another bloody Android patch, and to report back after that had been deployed. Outrageous. By now it really felt like I was just being taken for a fool.Numerous different agents handled my case at various points during this debacle, and their attitudes ranged from apathetic (and in one instance very rude as I was clearly being ignored while I spoke), to genuinely helpful but ultimately ineffective. I was offered Google Play credit twice by way of appeasement (the first offer didn't even land in my account, while the second did), which is not particularly desirable or useful to me in general, and in this specific case, utterly useless, as I had no working phone on which to use an app.Finally, after being mucked around and left without a working device for 55 days, I was offered a replacement refurbished phone (for a second time), as I should have been within the first couple of weeks of this process. Thankfully this arrived swiftly."

cie_A	Kelian Sarvin	2018-04-07T22:00:00Z	1	Censorship always by shadowbanning, that is to say that the censored user does not see his opinions or comments become invisible to others. You have to switch accounts or disconnect to find out.Censored negative opinions, comments or opinions that say a misleading truth about a company, an association, an employer, etc. are censored automatically or on demand. It's the same for a compromising YouTube channel.Creating fake accounts to post positive reviews or comments is always accepted by Google and never censored! Likewise for a YouTube channel intended for putaclic or deceptive but positive videos, especially for propaganda, advertising, for sects, etc.
cie_A	Gérard Hubert	2018-04-07T22:00:00Z	1	Through censorship of compromising opinions and comments (the truth disturbs) and false positive opinions easily created and never deleted, Google is complicit in scams, sects, frauds, bad employers, terrorism ...Indeed, this multinational and giant of the Web, which is, originally, the first search engine, the best known worldwide, created in 1998, allows itself to arbitrarily censor reviews, on Google Review, Youtube channels and the posts in the forums, when they harm the interests of capitalism regardless of the legality of companies, businesses, associations, sects, terrorism, etc.Google now allows bosses, CEOs, employers to remove negative comments and opinions about their companies from injured employees and ex-employees who have been harmed even if they have been victimized by wrongdoing. from their employers, in capitalism, just justice does not exist!Financial interest outweighs the safety of Internet users.Many bugs never corrected despite complaints from users, on Google, Youtube ...On the other hand, Google works hard and very well, to work around ad blockers, cookie blockers, plotters blockers, and so on. It's still the lure of gain that drives him to work as well for the marketing, advertising and theft of personal data, and Google is not the only one to behave in this area, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft (Cortana), Twitter, and all the multinationals have, in mind, only pure profit!The world is bad, the neutrality of the net is compromised by the capture of Internet users to the hegemony and the monopoly of a small group of giants of the web, namely Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, ...Similarly, the world is now in the hands of a cartel of a small number of banks and rich in finance. Western and Third World countries have been literally bought by banks, multinationals, and so on.

A lot of technical innovations and his AI.BUT especially:Stealing personal data!Google employees sometimes exhausted and abused!Opinion of censored Googles Reviews without the author being able to know it by the principle of shadowbanning or ghostbanning.Notices are manipulated to artificially raise the rating of companies by false positive opinions but never censored.Now allows employers to remove negative opinions from employees or former employees who have been injured or who have suffered injustices from their employer!When someone blocks or removes a comment, on Google reviews, Youtube, Google + ..., you did not know because Google uses the shadowban, and to find out if your account is affected or not, you have to disconnect from his account and if the reviews, comments, likes or dislikes have disappeared, your account has been blocked or censored.It is hypocritical, as in a couple where the spouse deceives the other (adultery for example) or the radio silence.Instagram practices the same thing.Google as other multinationals of the web have regulations and fuzzy contracts, to deceive their users for profit!
cie_A	Francine Martin	2018-04-05T22:00:00Z	1	Censorship very bad on reviews, shadowban bad reviews and not ban fake good reviews. If you are blocked by someone on Youtube for example, you are shadowbanned, you can discover that if you logout to your shadowbanned account and see your comments, likes and dislikes not displayed except if you are logged to your shadowbanned account.

And it refused to display a home-page splash-screen logo depicting 'Easter' - one of the major Christian / Jewish celebrations around the word. So why would it refuse to do so? Obviously because Google is now so big that the CEO and staff think that they can dismiss the millions who have religious beliefs that do not match their own agenda.

cie_A	david	2018-04-01T22:00:00Z	1	Bat skat crazy!!  Customer service is practically non-existent.  Their reasoning is unreasonable.  For instance, if they claim that there has been a serious breach of security because someone has tried to login to my account, (ie myself from a different device than what I originally used to sign-in from) then they require myself to reset the password....but...but...but...to reset the password I have to enter the original/current password first???  Surely if someone has tried to get into the account and used the password, this system just allows that someone to well errr.. reset the password.  And you are forced to do it if you want to continue using the account.  Of course I have stopped using google....idiots!!!!

cie_A	Lucas Francisco	2018-03-13T23:00:00Z	1	I couldn't unlock my phone because I forgot my pattern, so I spent an hour trying to fix a problem I had with my Google Pixel (you know, the phone made by Google). The customer support rep was foreign, which isn't a race problem, but rather a communication one. We were constantly cutting each other off, and he often failed to grasp what I was trying to explain in the first place.When we finally did manage to establish what the problem was (which I'd been trying to explain since we began), he wanted me to try things that may have been useful if I A.) had some trivial issue, B.) had a phone five years out of date, or C.) had called the second I couldn't unlock my phone. When the advice he gave me obviously failed, he told me they may be able to help if I pay $150 for them to unlock my phone. I assume he realized that wasn't going to happen in a million years and I'd have to be an absolute fool to do that, so he told me there was nothing they could do and I'd bricked my phone. Then he hung up on me.
cie_A	Andy E.	2018-03-10T23:00:00Z	1	"This saga of poor customer service spans 3 months, 22 contacts, 3 devices and a class action lawsuit. The take home version is that Google are happy for you to pay a premium price for a product but will provide budget service. They are no Apple. Stick with Apple if you're thinking about switching.I bought a Google Pixel on Project Fi and also purchased the extended device protection. After 14 months the microphone stopped working after an operating system update while I was abroad. I went online to the Google support forums and tried all of the suggested fixes, including a hard reset but this didn't help. I contacted Google customer support via the support app on the phone. - The first representative said they couldn't help as they were from the Google UK team. They promised that they would pass my case to the US team and that I would get an email back. THIS NEVER HAPPENED. - When I got back to the US, I contacted Google again via the app to report the issue with the microphone. The app again connected me with the UK team who said they could not help and didn't know why I hadn't been contacted by email. - I rang Google's customer services and after explaining the issue was told that the only way to resolve this was to claim on my extended warranty, including a $70 excess fee. - After doing this I saw online that a number of other customers had experienced the same issue and some had even organized a class action lawsuit against Google about this. A number of customers who hadn't purchased the extended warranty reported being given replacement handsets at no extra cost, even though they were beyond the initial warranty period. - When I called Google to enquire about this and to find out why this hadn't been offered to me, the first call handler HUNG UP the call having been totally uninterested in helping.  - I rang back and had to wait for 20 minutes to speak to a supervisor who advised that she could not review the previous call as it hadn't been logged on their system. She also advised she couldn't see any of the account notes from my previous messages and calls. She promised to check with a product specialist about my issue and follow up by email in 5-7 business days. After 2 emails saying she was still waiting to hear back and promising to continue to resolve my query, she stopped emailing. - Nearly 3 weeks after receiving an email promising me a response in 5-7 business days I emailed back to ask for an update. In response I received an email saying ""the case has been moved to email queue. As the account is not authenticated and therefore, I'll not be able to check for the details via email. I'd request you to please contact us again via phone and mention this case ID, so that next agent will help you directly."" - When I called up, the Google representative I spoke to (1) couldn't access the case associated with the case ID I had been provided; (2) needed me to explain in detail the entire issue that had resulted in the call; (3) placed me on hold for a total of 30 minutes while he tried to get a response from a product specialist. I was then put through to a product specialist at Project Fi who advised that I needed to be put through the Google Store customer service team. I then spent another 90 minutes on the phone, much of it on hold, only to be told that they weren't the department that could deal with my issue but promising to chase up the previously raised query soon. - In addition to this frustrating, fractured and inconsistent approach to customer service, my replacement Pixel began to malfunction, requiring a further replacement under my insurance.I have lost any faith that Google know how to run a consumer goods company. Their representatives, even when polite and well meaning, do not have access to information about your account that falls outside of their division. They also have insufficient autonomy to rapidly resolve issues. I have been interrupted, hectored and condescended by their staff in a way I have never experienced when dealing with Apple. I will be moving back to the iPhone and Apple's seamless customer service at the next possible opportunity."

Google loses my Pixel XL, claims I sent them a broken HTC, and tries to give me $35. After much kicking and screaming, they finally give me the extra $375.......but in Google store credit instead of putting it on my charge account that I used to buy my new Pixel.....as was promised.Then as a glutton for punishment I buy a Google WiFi router. I have it for less than 2 months and it dies. I contact customer service and after the usual troubleshooting stuff, I'm told to send in the purchase information, serial numbers, and what not. I think ""wow that was easy. Maybe my first experience was just a fluke"" 2 days have passed and nothing from Google. A multi BILLION dollar company dragging their feet to replace a $100 router that probably cost them $5 to make.Worst customer service EVER. Do your self a favor and stay away from Google electronic products. They aren't bad products but God help you if you have a problem need help from Customer Service."

cie_A	Stephanie Papais	2018-02-28T23:00:00Z	1	"Google, by far, is one of the worst customer service experiences that I've had. They have a shady and manipulative trade in process. Even after sending my phone with evidence (picture and video) that there was NO damage upon shipping AND addressing it with them prior that I didn't feel the packaging was sufficient, I wasn't given the full value of my phone and after a month, all they could offer is $50 store credit. After a month of demanding to see evidence of the claims since they started saying the screen was broken and then that there were dead pixels, they circled back to the same thing after ""escalating"" it to who knows who and having us wait without an update or semblance of intelligence behind the resolution. The entire process proved that Google doesn't care about it's customers and holds unethical practices that are fraudulent and shady. I would never trust them with anything again and I would never advocate to use their products either."

Most answers are straightforward with the first link usually being what I am looking for with certain exception. The only problem with the search engine would be the fact that you can pay for your site to be the first links and its lack of anonymity. Although they do this, these sites are usually relevant to what I am looking for and as for privacy it is something that has been taken away with social media in general so I don´t think its fair to rate the search engine badly just because everything isn´t deleted after searched.

As you will later discover, anyone (even a child!!!) can add a completely false review on your site, marking all your hard efforts down, and there is nothing you can do about it! So working hard to get good customer reviews is a complete waste of time

Google has acknowledged this wide-spread defect for months and even replaced other owners' out-of-warranty devices with new Pixels. In my instance, they are refusing to do anything, citing a new policy against doing anything for devices outside of their warranties. For a ""premium"" device to ship with a defective battery that fails after one year is an outrage.

My business page got suspended for some ""quality issue"" and ive been trying to get in touch and find out about the details of this issue and how it can be fixed for almost three months. Mind you, regular calls and emails to their support team - 2-3 times a week and I get zero legible response, or on the phone they say they can't help me but their experts will reach out by email, and I'm sent an automated email telling me that my business page is suspended, like thanks I know that's what I'm trying to fix."

They view you as a product and not a customer to most of the services.  From play store to google Fi to Gmail/Drive.  Spent 2hrs on the phone with them getting the run around to then be told that a level 3 support person would get back to me in 24hrs which never happened.

Gmail insecure and obtrusive.Do not buy a Pixel phone, they are a nightmare.Google pixel is an utter nightmare: I am on my third replacement since December 2016 due to faulty phones which my poor phone company replaced because google take no responsibility.  The claim in shops that you can get 7 hours use from 15 minute charge is a lie, knowingly made.   Recurring problems with battery, phone mike, Bluetooth, wifi.  Google Assistant is totally unreliable as it works intermittently 10%. Of time.Google support utterly unhelpful.Buyer beware of the pixel phones.

I bought ticket to a concert over Craigslist and payed the ""person"" over Google Wallet. Long story short, never received the tickets and I thought my $180 was lost forever. The next day I called Google Customer Service to see if they could just put her username on the watch list so this didn't happen to anyone else. They told me not to worry and opened an investigation to ensure that I was actually scammed. No more than 24 hours later Google sent me an email saying my money would be put back into my account in 3-5 days. Throughout the entire process every person I was in contact with made me feel calm, respected, and at ease. Thank you Google for giving me such a wonderful experience."

cie_A	IHeartOnlineShopping	2017-05-24T22:00:00Z	5	"I am a power user on the Internet. I multi-task all the time and I need to be able to find what I am looking for quickly and easily without an hesitation. Google is my favorite search engine. I've tried them all. Google doesn't give you the awful advertising like Bing and it doesn't give you the scattered results like Yahoo. I have always been able to find what I want on Google without too much work on my part which is nice. I know a lot of people get frustrated with Google because they cannot find what they are looking for. I think part of that is people try to ""change"" what they want to find into words Google can understand. The thing is, Google doesn't work like other search engines, you can ask it a question like a human being, and it can find you an answer like a human being. You don't have to know computer lingo or any other codes to get the answer that you want from Google. For instance, if you want to know all of the movies that star a certain celebrity instead of typing ""movies that star (celebrity name)"" you can simply type ""celebrity name movies"" and get a list.One of my favorite parts about Google is how versatile the search is. If someone sends you a picture on the Internet that you think might be fake, you can click on images, drag and drop the photograph to Google, and find out if they just pulled the photograph right off the Internet. I love the image search because you can use it for just about everything. For instance, I found a black bug in my house with white spots, and I typed black bug with white spots into Google and then clicked images, and there are photographs of tons of bugs. All I do is click on the one that matches what I found, and I can instantly identify the bug. This is just one example of the way to use the image search. I also really like the news search feature on Google. If there is a specific news topic that you need to research you can type the topic in, click on news and it will give you a huge list of applicable news articles from sources all over the internet. They don't just pick and choose a few select ""approved"" news sources, but instead they give you every news source you can think of, even local news. The shopping search on Google is also very nice because it gives you a price comparison within Google without having to visit multiple websites. I love that I can see the price of an item at any store from E-bay to Walmart and every store in between. This allows me to shop for the best price every time I make a purchase without searching dozens of websites. I've compared prices on my own vs searching for prices under the Google shopping search and only once did I find a lower price on my own as opposed to the prices that Google showed. The books search is one of the most valuable. It will actually search parts of books and then highlight the phrase you searched for in that book. It's invaluable for research when you need to quote your sources. I don't know how I ever got through college without it (because it didn't exist back then). The maps are also something that I love, from locating a new restaurant to getting driving directions to the doctor's office, I love that I can type in any location in the world, click on maps, and get a map of the location and/or driving directions to and from the location. It incorporates Google Earth type technology, but loads faster and easier, and it's available on the Internet vs downloading Google Earth to your computer. Google is close to perfect, which is saying a lot for a search engine. The one thing I would change is the fact that it stores pages that no longer exist. I've found ways around this, by submitting removal requests for information, but at the end of the day, I wish Google could check for web pages that no longer exist so that I did not have to click on multiple websites only to find out that the information is no longer thereI will continue to use Google as long as it's superior to other search engines, and I don't see that changing any time soon!"

Google service asked to send them everything that came with a phone. So we did and as a replacement they send us different repaired phone not even including a charger. Such a waste of time and money. Disappointed in Google.

He didn't know what he did was wrong, so i contacted google about this and changed my password and took my debit cards off. The refused to refund me even though i spoke to a forum in which 200+ people replied saying they got refunds for unauthorized purchases. So it seems Google refused me because my son is disabled!! Disability discrimination at it's finest.

cie_A	John Borkenhagen	2017-04-21T22:00:00Z	1	My credit card showed Fraudulent charges for Google Services.  10 charges showed up within a few minutes.I called Google support.  They said the charges did not come from my account, but my credit card was used.  I asked Google support what product or service my card was used for.  Google support said they were unable to tell me.  My on line AmEx account had additional information including seller ID and Google Services transaction number, but Google support was not interested in that information.I asked to talk to the supervisor.  I gave all the same information to the supervisor and got the same responses.  He said he was the end of the line and no one else at Google could help me.  He was pleasant and apologized for the inability for Google to provide any help with fraudulent Google Services charges.I called AmEx after getting off the phone with Google.  They gave me the name of the Google services business that made the charges.  It was in China and fraudulent charges from multiple other credit cards were also made to the same China company.  The credit card number, expiration date, and security code were all used for the fraudulent charges.  AmEx fraud department is working the case.  I am guessing someone sold a database with credit card info to the China company.Google has as much or more compute power than AmEx.  Google should use some of its compute power to do the same fraud detection and prevention for Google Services that American Express.  I will avoid doing any card transactions through Google whenever possible until they get serious about providing value add to their services.

cie_A	American Eagle	2017-03-31T22:00:00Z	1	Three tech support staffers could not fix google assistant app on a 5 days old Pixel 128GB phone. They had the nerves to offer me a refurbished(used) phone as a replacement for my new phone. One of them when I mentioned may be I should file a lawsuit against Google he said to go a head and a Google attorney will contact me. This is my  10th Google device that I purchased in the last three year. You can tell I am a google guy. I paid close to $5,000.00 for Google devices and at the end I get an offer for a used replacement  and to  go to hell if I don't like it. At this time Google will never a penny out of me and it is time to switch to Apple at this time and I will on my next phone. By the way I fixed the phone without Google's lack of competence and knowledge of there own phones.

Theys till have not replied to my request to removed altogether from the review systemWe do not know these individuals as they are not our clients and we do not have their addresses. for us to take them to Court, which is what Google are asking a small business like ours to do. Instead of investigating these people who gave us a bad review with no evidence at all.So how do we pursue someone in a court of law that we do not know. We do not know who these reviewers were or their addresses. So Google has a legal and moral duty to remove these reviews as Google themselves have no evidence that these people have a right to do a review on our Company.

Please note that Google reviews are a forum for users to share both positive and negative opinions. At Google, we try to help our users find and learn about places that they are looking for in the physical world. User reviews help users learn about a business, so we do not remove reviews unless they violate our policies. We also will not be removing the entire business listing from Google Maps, nor can it be removed.If your business received a review that you don’t agree with, we encourage you to use business owner responses to reconcile the situation with the customer. We know a negative review can be frustrating, but we believe that engaging with a customer to address his or her concerns creates the best environment for our community.Regards,The Google Team________________________________________Let me tell you we had asked for the false and corrupt review to be removed and then we asked for ourselves then toi be removed in view of their disgusting attitude towards small enterprises that are being slandered at the hands of Google.

cie_A	Abiss	2017-01-11T23:00:00Z	5	I don't normally contact Google customer service. However, I received their instant reply or call everytime I contacted. They made an effort to call and check what's wrong or what kind of help I need.I also find cheaper price buying service from Google directly than their reseller. If anyone looks for the quality service, help or reasonable price, I recommend you to connect with Google team directly.

I have tried 3 times now for a warranty phone replacement (I even paid an extra $150 dollars for google protect) the service is just plain bad. I like the google phone but would be hard pressed to buy another piece of google hardware given my experience.

cie_A	Luis Angel Lopez	2016-12-10T23:00:00Z	1	"To summarize my problem as best as possible. For a reason that google could never explain, my google account had a hold that prevented me to buy apps through credit/debit cards and also did not allow me to redeem gift cards.It all started on a Wednesday where I made my first call. In that call they told me that they had to pass the case to another department and the process to solve it would take about 24 hours when they would send me an email indicating the solution. 24 hours later I call again since I had not heard from them. At this time I was told the same thing as the first time. I told them that my impatient to resolve the case was to buy some apps that were special for thanksgiving dates, but they tried to reassure me by saying that these specials usually lasted throughout the Christmas season. Again they told me to wait 24 hours where they were supposed to contact me with the solution. 24 hours later they did not answer. I go back and I call, on this occasion I was told ""Wait always has its rewards"" to fall in love with they... This time I was told to wait 12 hours for the final answer. 12 hours later I call again, this time the customer service told me sharply ""anyone who calls every day will not expedite or solve the problem"" and to top this he told me to wait 3 days for the solution. LOL, I laugh because to summarize, I had to create another account to redeem the gift card but it was to late, the apps had gone up in price. Ironically, within 2 days of doing this I get an email from google saying that they had already solved the problem of my account ... 2 WEEKS AND HALF to solve this. THAT'S WHY APPLE IS APPLE ..."

But try to block them access and you may as well forget using the Internet all together. In theory you can change your settings to prevent Google services any access to your data,but this requires removing all your Google accounts from the net,without which you can no longer use the majority of the most popular and useful features and sites.Try to do a simple little thing as per Googles ""helpful"" step by step instructions and you'll be going round in circles looking for the listed next option that doesn't come up on your screen as described in Googles instructions and will be guaranteed to accomplish little more than give you a great big migraine!From what I've seen of Googles dealings and read in the small print under their ""terms and conditions "", you may as well sell your soul to the devil,a terminology not wasted with its irony on someone who has come to the conclusion Google may very well be the  Antichrist prophesied by the Bible in the book of Revelations!

For such a large company, you would think they would provide some kind of customer support contact which actually works. Basically seem to want you fix problems yourself or just directs you to the forum.Here's a thought.  Why not put the ""Forgot Password"" option back on the email system?  This would save a lot of frustration and wasted time.  Especially when you can no longer access your recovery email."

Some just swear and others leave their invite codes (literally spam) so Google has a serious issue with QC of this department, heck, Amazon makes sure that the folks who review stuff on their website do not make these mistakes so come on, Google!Really hope that Google can clean up the reviews and make it more civilised on the Play Store.

He certainly painted, everything including her hardwood, light switch's, brackets on doors. he didn't bother sanding anything before painting, and even broke her screen door. Obviously my Auntie, was not satisfied with this, tried working with Mike to make things right, He was extremely rude, Belligerent and ignorant to her as well as her daughter and son in law.

I contacted them explaining my business services and suggesting that a suitable category be opened, for I am not the only business to offer such services. I actually suggested two category listings ""Home Organisation"" and ""Property Staging"", as neither existed. google emailed me and the exchange continued for some time, yet it was them merely spinning me a yarn and lied to me. google had NO intention of creating the two suggested categories. As google deliberately FAIL to create the two categories my business is lumbered under ""cleaning""! When I receive enquiries from people who are looking for those services I then have to explain that I do not provide such services. Naturally, they are curious to know why my business is listed under ""cleaning"" to which I advise that google FAIL to create two relevant categories whist google simply and continuously lied to me.I realise there are other search engine options available, yet google has the monopoly. So long as they are paid they really don't give two hoots about their customer for they regard them as cash cows.It's so annoying that one search engine provider can treat its customers with such disrespect, irritation, annoyance and inconvenience."

After pushing pay now, the page hang for some minutes, and nothing happened. I had to reload the page, and the invoice was still unpaid, so i paid again, and again with a hanging page. After that, i could see the bill was paid twice from my card.I contacted them to get the money back, but according to them, it is not possible, only if i terminate the account ?????

I received no actions and no replies. I walked to see them more than 6 times. From 29 Jan 2015 to 1 June 2015, we reported the failure of essential service of the floor heating on 29 Jan to 15 April 2015. My son suffered in cold winter for more than 3 months. The room temperature was continuously below -2 to 2 degree in month of Jan/ Feb 2015 and most of the nights were 0 deg C in March 2015. The technician took a month to order and replaced the thermostats, but it fails to work. He told me that, in Empress Court, many units have the same problem as electrical heating mat is not functioning, after 15 yrs. They cannot replace the mat by digging up the floor. The Manager,  Richard Goodwin has promised to compensate us £350 and said this is under his sole authorities, as we suffered more than 3 months of cold winter and also we have to buy a portable heater. After we checked out on June 15, 2015, he said that the landlord disagreed to pay. He has ignored all our calls and emails. Richard has a good win! Eric

What is supplanting this function?  Also when i use google i get different results nearly everyday.  And when I use my wife's or someone elses device the results are so strangely different that... well here is an analogy.

Everytime I went to log into my msn account, gambling pages etc would pop up. I also had random messages popping up saying that things were out of date etc, like Java. My laptop is brand new and I have only had it a few months. Anyway, today I uninstalled Google Chrome and installed Firefox instead which, thankfully, is so much better...I have already noticed a big difference. My laptop is so much faster and I havent had any adverts or anything pop up. So if there is one bit of advice I can give anyone, DO NOT HAVE GOOGLE CHROME ON YOUR LAPTOP.

Navigating through all the Google+ none sense has become a real pain when all you want is to check your e mail.Love the services you're good at Google.  Please just stick to those!
cie_A	Bryan  Doull	2014-05-24T22:00:00Z	2	It has been over 30 days since I signed-up for the Google product Adsense and my account has neither been approved or denied. There is not anything in the help or support sections that I can use until Google tells me what is going on.Google makes it impossible to contact them directly and actively uses its technology to avoid interaction. I do not want you to just believe me. I want you to test the Google help and support features before you sign up for a Google program and see for yourself. Ask yourself- is this a level of support that is satisfactory for me? Google would rather customers rely on user forums for problem solving. Even if I give Google the benefit of the doubt and they just want customers to help each other to build some sort of peer team spirit, there are some very good reasons user forums are questionable for customer service.1. There is not any obligation on the part of other users to answer a question so many questions go unanswered.2. Many well meaning members of a user forum are not familiar enough with Google products or providing customer service and will give incomplete or overly technical answers that are useless to the help seeker.3. Google is weakening itself. Google.s competition could easily be monitoring Google's user forums for technical information and weaknesses in Google products that can be used to build something better. Making customers rely on each other makes it easy for them to give away valuable product details publicly. Frustrated customers are going to feel obligated to post the technical details of  the Google products they use all over the internet seeking help with their problem if Google does not provide direct product troubleshooting service of its own products. Thus, by providing poor customer service Google is pushing customers to give away its secrets.I was lucky, I found out about Google’s lack of customer service before I signed-up for a Google application that required a payment. What Google seems to be forgetting is that first impressions count for so much in business and there are now many others out there like me who may never trust Google with a paid product because of Google's attitude toward customer service.The other thing Google forgets is that my success using their application also allows Google to earn additional revenue.Hold on. Wow. Suddenly I am not so upset. Google's lack of customer service is costing them money as well. When I multiply it out for everyone Google is probably frustrating with its customer service policies, Google must be developing a serious revenue leak somewhere.Hey Google-let me remind you that there was another seemingly unstoppable internet powerhouse that failed because of poor customer relations as much as any other reason: AOL. Think about it.

cie_A	Destiny	2014-04-15T22:00:00Z	5	GOOGLE is the best search engine! I use google for everything!
cie_A	Eric	2014-04-09T22:00:00Z	5	Very easy to use, and love the doodles on the site. Excellent search results as well. Would recommend.
cie_A	Erma	2014-04-02T22:00:00Z	5	Any information you need its on Google. Its my favorite search engine.
cie_A	J wilson	2014-03-24T23:00:00Z	4	Google is one of the greatest search engines but they really need to work on the precision part. the results that come up should be exact.
cie_A	Nick Togias	2014-03-23T23:00:00Z	3	Great search engine. But sometimes i get too many useless search results on top which makes me not to use it anymore
cie_A	duty yek	2014-03-16T23:00:00Z	5	Google is king when it comes to search engines. But it it so much more then that I am a big fan of many of the services Google offers. I have been using gmail since forever. I have Google phone for call and text. And the list goes on and on. There is not  enough time or space to express my love for all things Google.  I can hardly wait to try Google glass!
cie_A	jean dup	2014-03-14T23:00:00Z	5	Google is one of the best search engines so far. I use it one a daily basis and find almost everything there.
cie_A	Evelin Knopp	2014-03-13T23:00:00Z	5	Well said, Enrico!These are exactly the same words I wanted to write down here.I love this platform and I'm using it day in day out. Actually it has been quite a long time I didn't used it and that for some reason.Get in and you know what we are talking about! ;-)CheersEvelin
cie_A	Enrico Schmidi	2014-03-12T23:00:00Z	5	If you don't know about something Google is the tool to use!Actually you can explore about all and everything you're looking for, becauseGoogle knows everyhting. It just depends on the way of usage.
cie_A	Chase Spruill	2014-03-12T23:00:00Z	5	There is no question- Google is the ACME of our modern day.  They are the true future rulers of the world. From Google glasses - a computer on your face always.  To self - driving cars. to Google images - search for any image you want by picture or name, to facial recognition to artificial intelligence to robots. top operating systems that are taken over the entire world to the largest cell-phone system in the world.Oh and they've got a darn mean search site too.
cie_A	Aaron Yiu	2014-03-07T23:00:00Z	2	Not cool.   Google tracks you all over the place so they can serve you up ads and barely says anything about it all in the very, very, very fine print hidden in their mammoth millions of pages.
cie_A	Kyle Ervin	2014-02-26T23:00:00Z	5	Time and Time again, Google has provided me with information relevant to my search. Other search engines just don't compare in terms of layout, speed, and results. I can expect what I'm looking for to be within the first page of my search with Google. The other search engines just don't provide that kind of personalized accuracy. Even when searching for video or images, Google consistently provides a better ranking of the results in a much more clear and efficient manner. Sometimes the most well known company is always the best, in this case there isn't a better choice for your search engine. I will use Google until I'm 80 years old.
cie_A	Sumit Goel	2014-02-23T23:00:00Z	5	No doubt Google is the best search engine. Almost it is the King of the Internet.
cie_A	AJ	2014-02-22T23:00:00Z	5	I use it for everyday life. Whether it's for research, looking at pictures, or even fun, it's pretty much the only search engine you need nowadays. This website's come a long way from humble beginnings to be the #1 search choice worldwide.
cie_A	Robert Burke	2014-02-14T23:00:00Z	5	"From their website: ""Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.""  Great search engine, and with any tool, the more you know about it, the better the results when using it.  Parents should look into Google extensive parental controls, to be sure that adult results are filtered better.  There is no way to remove all adult content, but the vast majority can be filtered.  Google has many tools, from local listings, drag and drop image searches and provide a variety of services for people and businesses."
cie_A	Jens Riemann	2014-02-10T23:00:00Z	5	I use google for every kind of information I'm looking for. If I'm looking for a new haircut or if I just want to know which movie I'm looking for, it doesn't matter because Google always helps me immediately.To tell the truth, I don't now if I could manage my life without google as I do it right now. :p
cie_A	Frederik	2014-02-08T23:00:00Z	4	Google Chrome is a very good browser, quick fast and easy to figure out.But be careful, google are said to hide their cookies and stuff on your computer. Privacy invasion and heavy tax avoidance are some of the things Google have been known for in the recent years.
cie_A	Saul	2014-01-27T23:00:00Z	5	I find everything I am looking for.
cie_A	Raquel Tejada	2014-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	This must be the mother of all search engines. The search time is amazing the information provided is very good and the other features such as google maps and talk are great
cie_A	manfred	2014-01-15T23:00:00Z	4	Google is the best search engine, with the best results.Adwords I don't like though.
cie_A	Viola	2014-01-01T23:00:00Z	5	GOOGLE is number one! I love this search engine and always use it. Very grateful!
cie_A	C.Mandy	2013-12-31T23:00:00Z	5	Google is a part and parcel of my daily life!! Cant just imagine my life without it. Really impressed with Chrome and drive. The doodle for new year was fantabulous!! Loved it!!!
cie_A	Nanda Kishore	2013-12-16T23:00:00Z	5	Better than the Best
cie_A	Alana Cole	2013-11-18T23:00:00Z	4	This site is my personal favorite search engine. Love that I can search just about anything and get what you are looking for.
cie_A	Alex Langowski	2013-10-30T23:00:00Z	5	Hard to imagine life without it now. They deserve all 5 stars & more.
cie_A	Grigori Feresin	2013-10-13T22:00:00Z	4	if there was a god, he would search google.combesides all apps that makes life easier, google.com is integrated with android, chrome, gmail... got to love it!
cie_A	dean	2013-10-10T22:00:00Z	5	The best site ever!Always answer on everything!
cie_A	JG1219	2013-09-29T22:00:00Z	5	I use this every time I need to search for something online. That could be from a song lyric that's stuck in my head to where to find the best restaurant in my neighborhood. The searches are generally fairly quick and bring up the information I need. I find Google's interface clean and simple, which I prefer.
cie_A	John Creighton	2013-08-01T22:00:00Z	4	I use Google for nearly aspect of my professional life. I use Gmail for my email, Drive for document and picture savings, Calendar for scheduling and on and on. Analytics help find out my stats for websites. If Google were every shut down, I'm pretty sure my entire business life would go down the tubes. You'll find me talking to myself on the street trying to get it to work on cell phone. The only negative thing I can think about Google is that fact that I'm addicted to it like heroin.
cie_A	CyndySix	2013-07-16T22:00:00Z	5	"Last night I was thinking about ""Google"" being like a word ""Windex"" or ""Kleenex"".  You never say ""I'm going to ""Yahoo"" it, or I'm going to ""Bing"" it (that might conjure up something weird!)  But everybody says ""I'm going to Google that"" and we all know exactly what they mean!  It's like if I say I ""Windexed"" the windows or I need a ""Kleenex"".  Everyone knows immediately what I'm talking about.""Google"" has obviously become the generic trademark for internet searches.  That's why I stick with the giant and biggest authority out there.  I trust Google to be the most vast, most knowledgeable, and most secure search engine out there.  Love it."
cie_A	Deb	2013-07-15T22:00:00Z	5	I really love using google everytime i have a problem , sometimes it may sound stupid but it do helps you
cie_A	Sam	2013-07-02T22:00:00Z	5	Google, after Apple of course, is the best company out there. I just lovethe fact that they feed their users the best possible results in the shortest time span. When im looking for answer, it barely takes me a minute to find.
cie_A	Jay Jay	2013-06-27T22:00:00Z	5	In every aspect Google is leading the charge! Thanks for being amazing!
cie_A	Alex Page	2013-05-22T22:00:00Z	5	Theses guys have it all. I love the maps!
cie_A	Curt Staley	2013-05-16T22:00:00Z	5	Still the best in the business. They can bing it on if they want, but Google is still the tops!
cie_A	Liz4H	2013-04-27T22:00:00Z	5	Google has always been my go-to search bar because it is simple, easy to use and gives great quality results.
cie_A	Michael Olsson	2013-04-21T22:00:00Z	5	Everybody love Google no doubt about that ....if you don't love Google you are not connected! :)
cie_A	Ajey Chandhan	2013-04-17T22:00:00Z	5	Google is well experienced and the most used search engine in the world.It delivers the best results in a matter of seconds.It integrates well with other google services and products..So far the best search engine in this world :)
cie_A	John Sutton	2013-04-01T22:00:00Z	5	Suojit is the bomb! Great work on the latest version of Google Mobile Search.
cie_A	Chloe Anderson	2013-02-25T23:00:00Z	5	The best tool for information seeking on the internet
cie_A	Mats Söderhäll	2013-01-10T23:00:00Z	1	"Google has this nasty habit of suspending people and companies for no apparent reason, without explanation or any way of getting your account un-suspended.Make sure you never get dependent on any google service (such as gmail, apps, adwords, adsense or similar). They can close your account without any other explanation than ""policy violation"" and they do not care if the mistake is yours or theirs.Try to Goggle(!) on ""google account suspended"".It is not only very small companies that get dumped. There are hundreds of companies who spent 100.000USD/year on Google-products who suddenly get their account closed without explanation.How much would it cost you if Google suddenly close your accounts?"
cie_A	Lisa L. Thorne	2012-12-03T23:00:00Z	5	I love Google Chrome.....all my faves are always with me, and everything I need is all in a single login.
cie_A	Michael D	2012-11-21T23:00:00Z	5	It's tough to live without google now.
cie_A	Christopher English	2012-11-21T23:00:00Z	5	Google is much better search engine than Yahoo or Bing, or any others. Run the search for any search term and you will see for yourself.
cie_A	Christian T	2012-11-04T23:00:00Z	5	I just bought an account with Google Apps. I contacted their support to try to get help with migrating my mails from my old account. I was already thinking that it would be a long shot to get usefull help from such a big company as Google.That was quickly put to shame.Two hours later I got a call from Google support. I didn't have time, but they would call me back at any time that was convenient for me.So I scheduled a call for the next day and ended up getting 40+ minutes of personal support. Migrating my mails turned out to be quite a complex matter.So a big thanks to Sylwia from Enterprise Support, for being very helpful and very nice to talk to.
cie_A	Stefan Hauge	2012-11-03T23:00:00Z	4	I currently have hotmail however gmail works for your google docs and excell and last but not least it works in my android :)keep up the good work
cie_A	Miss steph slater	2012-10-27T22:00:00Z	5	i find that Google usually has the most accurate results im looking for, where as bing i have to scroll through numerous pages before i can find what im looking for. plus with the additions of translations, google maps, lavely......
cie_A	Brock Cooper	2012-10-22T22:00:00Z	5	When Google first became popular, I didn't really think much of them. I didn't like the enormity of the company and their offerings, but one day I decided to use Google Mail.Google Maps soon help me get where I was going. Google Docs helped me keep my PDFs and Docs safe from a damaged computer or disaster. Google Talk let me talk to my wife, family and clients. I have become a Googlephile and I love it. I can't imagine how my life would work without Google everything. Thank you Google for making my life easier and more connected.
cie_A	Scott Mishler	2012-10-19T22:00:00Z	5	I am a self professed googlephile, I use it daily for secure gmail, docs, maps, keyword tool and oh yeah searching. I have obtained my masters degree from the university of Google and proud of it!
cie_A	Anton	2012-10-17T22:00:00Z	5	I do with google almost everything. Just love this company
cie_A	Sebastian Gorgon	2012-09-27T22:00:00Z	5	Google as a company is amazing. They have many useful services i couldn't go a day without using, Android, Gmail, Search Engine, Google Maps, and so much more. I never had a problem with google and i been using them all my life!.
cie_A	Little Bill	2012-09-27T22:00:00Z	5	Is there anything else should be said about Google? Google changed the world with the fast reliable search and all features and services that were created over the short period without which it is hard to imagine the world today.
cie_A	Sebastian Søe	2012-09-24T22:00:00Z	5	Great! I use google for everything and everyday! Cannot recommend anything else for Searching the web!
cie_A	Liat more	2012-09-22T22:00:00Z	5	can you imagine world with out google? i cant thank god for google

cie_A	Jenna Shuman	2012-09-17T22:00:00Z	5	I can always find what i am looking for if i just google it! Everyone should use google.
cie_A	Rachel Thompson	2012-09-17T22:00:00Z	5	I love google, at work we use the word google now instead of search. We google everything we are looking for, whether its work related, hair product related or just gossip related and we always find what we are looking for. We love Google images too, its great for when you are telling a story but you just need to see it.
cie_A	Naomi Levi	2012-09-15T22:00:00Z	5	i love google. It makes it easy to find everything i am looking for

cie_A	Camilla Hansen	2012-09-04T22:00:00Z	5	Gmail, is easy to use, and you do not get any spam. I love it ;)
cie_A	Piper Westwood	2012-08-21T22:00:00Z	4	I'm been using Google for years from the everyday search engine to Google Places and more. The company has a lot of options, apps, services and more that help me in my everyday life, but sometimes when I do have problems it seems a little hard to get helpful answers to fixes to the problems. Still, its a good company that runs the gamut of services that make my life easier, so still a good company!
cie_A	Jamie Anderson	2012-08-16T22:00:00Z	5	Obviously Google is the best search engine, but it's range of additional features and apps are what make it a real winner.I never use anything else!
cie_A	Mona Kelly	2012-08-05T22:00:00Z	5	Really reliable and relevant searches. I doubt there is a company that could come up with a SE better than Google.
cie_A	Customer: Prof. Brian Bevan	2012-08-03T22:00:00Z	5	Google: I could say a lot but to sum up so as not to bore ones readers. The top search system ( not just an engine)Superb Email joust! Prolific and simply superb Picasa. Sketchup beats the S%^& out of many professional cad programmes. Their mapping software another huge winner; and so it goes on. I love GOOGLE!
cie_A	Gina Winston	2012-08-02T22:00:00Z	5	I haven't heard that any of my friends uses any browser other than Google. It is just way too superior.
cie_A	Frank Adams	2012-07-27T22:00:00Z	5	Google is much better search engine than Yahoo or Bing, or any others. Run the search for any search term and you will see for yourself.
cie_A	Patricia Young	2012-07-25T22:00:00Z	5	Gmail is an absolutely best mail service with its huge capacity, 100% uptime and loads of other utilities, all for free.
cie_A	Michael Ferguson	2012-07-23T22:00:00Z	5	I don't waste my time trying to search for something on other search engines. Google is the only obvious and logical choice.
cie_A	Azra Leith	2012-07-22T22:00:00Z	5	Definitely the best search engine out there. It sorts out the results in most relevant way.
cie_A	Dani Lang	2012-07-22T22:00:00Z	5	no adverts and always gives me something I want.
cie_A	Errol Lombard	2012-07-20T22:00:00Z	5	This is my favorite search engine.. Actually for a long time this is the only one that I use.

cie_A	Susan Houser	2012-07-17T22:00:00Z	5	When I placed my order 3 weeks out, I wondered if they would get it right.  They did get it right!  Delivered on expected date.  I would highly recommend PetFlow.
cie_A	Maverick06	2012-07-17T22:00:00Z	1	I made an error & deleted my account. Submitted request for help never heard from Google. Can not find a person to help. Only forms and huge online library.
cie_A	Dan. M	2012-07-17T22:00:00Z	5	When I first started using google, I used to get random ordered search lists that never contained what I was looking for, never got anything that was from my country and struggled to understand alot of what was in the search results...BUT NOW I use google nearly constantly for everything I need to find, whether that be music related news, weather, email or even gaming! Not only have they grown at an amazingly fast pace, but they have also become alot more user friendly and accessible to the public. I love all of the new features, including G+ (google+), which I myself use and have done since the days they were released!Google are much much better than their competitors which to me seem not to search for what your telling it to but to search instead for what they think you mean, which imo is rather annoying...Keep up the good work google!
cie_A	Karen Green	2012-07-17T22:00:00Z	5	I won't use anything else..
cie_A	Alexander  Vorobev	2012-07-16T22:00:00Z	5	Easy to find, exelent maps, best direction solutions, ans, of cause, I have GooglePhone!
cie_A	James Lindsey Brown	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	5	I wished I worked for Google cause they are the REAL DEAL and make me happy most days of my life...thanks for being all that you are...if you don't use them, you are stupido...and missing so much in the internet community...THANKS GOOGLE!!!!!!
cie_A	Harshiran	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	4	Google is like a magnifying glass you just ask for what you want and it just pops up in seconds.  What ever you want whenever you need it.  Even if its a question, if its maths you would type it in and it would probably pop up with a online virtual calculator how clever! Also the pick and drop a picture into the search box really helps.
cie_A	Al	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	5	Excellent services
cie_A	Ken	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	3	No operational issues and only two conditions I'm not completely happy with.  1:  If I wanted Crome, I would ask for it.  Quit trying to pass it off all the time.  2:  Censorship for political reasons, regardless of who's opinion it is, is NEVER in the best interest of the people.  For example, if you don't want to support ammunition sales for legal reason, then don't list those sites at all.  But singling them out becuse of someone in managements personal view of the issue is reprehensible!  Let people make up thier own minds
cie_A	Willie White	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	5	u can fine anything on google.
cie_A	Jaume López	2012-07-15T22:00:00Z	4	Many people seem to start to believe Google has grown too much, it holds too much power in our lives. That's probably true. However, what's unquestionably true is that it still provides the absolutely best search results in the globe.
cie_A	Donald Maynard	2012-07-14T22:00:00Z	5	I only use gmail for all my private and business needs. It is that good. And it never crashed on me.

cie_A	lisa nicholaou	2012-07-13T22:00:00Z	5	always finds what i am looking for
cie_A	Beth	2012-07-13T22:00:00Z	5	This is the only search engine I use. It now has so many features, you really need nothing else! I love the maps section, I use it often for directions. The images section is great too. I also use the shopping section quite a lot which is good however I do find it inaccurate a lot of the time. Nevertheless it is the best search engine around and it's always been my homepage and probably always will be!!
cie_A	Harold Crowe	2012-07-12T22:00:00Z	5	Anything you need to know place to go.
cie_A	Jean Sarsby	2012-07-12T22:00:00Z	5	I couldn't be without it if there's anything I want I just type it in. Its a very helpful service.

cie_A	Kevin Hoang	2012-07-11T22:00:00Z	5	I'm a loyal fan of google. Everything from search engine to apps and social networking. They keep things very simple and straight forward but also detailed when needed. There apps prevent spams and not as much advertising as some other stuff I've used. Overall, I usually set every pc i use to google as homepage and usually install chrome since it amazingly sync all my bookmarks and such with a simple install and log on. Best stuff ever!
cie_A	Jamie	2012-07-11T22:00:00Z	5	I can find exactly what I'm looking for everytime.
cie_A	Anna C	2012-07-11T22:00:00Z	3	"...but they're getting worst and worst with every passing year. The latest is that they're charging to list products in their ""shopping"" results which is pretty gross considering. Plus with their blatant desperate attempts to integrate their crappy social network Google+ into search results, it just makes THEM and their results seems less relevant with every search. I think it's time for Google to sink a la myspace style and make room for the next big thing."
cie_A	Jag	2012-07-10T22:00:00Z	5	Still the best and quickest
cie_A	Nick Barnett	2012-07-10T22:00:00Z	1	No I don't want to search the world every time I'm looking for something.I just want things that are in the UK.
cie_A	Lluis Massip	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	5	I have tried almost all applications to create albums for the Web. Compared with JAlbum some are easier to use but it is profitable to devote two or three sessions to learn JAlbum thoroughly, then he discovers powerful options and practical features not found in more expensive commercial programs. I am very satisfied with the purchase although I have not experienced the sale of pictures and videos through PayPal, one of the distinctive possibilities of JAlbum. Very good!
cie_A	Jane Pritchard	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	5	Google is a briliant site for information. Whatever the subject of your enquiry, they can usually find a site to help you. There are so many ways that Google can help. It is very easy to navigate round their site and I would highly recommend them.
cie_A	Martin Crocombe	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	5	You've got to love Google how would we live without them
cie_A	Sylvia Anderson	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	5	Better than a library.  I can find out about almost any subject I want.
cie_A	Johny Livinston	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	5	Ever wondered expecting answers for whatever input you give?? Well, here it is, Google at its best. I use most od the services offered by Google and its product, Android. Am a fan of Android, especially its ICS OS. The customer service is best, because once when my account got deleted, they helped me out recover it back. Anyway, I think Google can place a download link in youtube, play store etc. That's my suggestion. Rather I would recommend this product to all.
cie_A	Christine Hanner	2012-07-09T22:00:00Z	5	Google = where to find everything internet with no confusion or pop-ups!
cie_A	Tess McIntyre	2012-07-08T22:00:00Z	5	Let's face it, without google we would be lost and have to rely on the likes of 'Bing' and what-not. Its easy to use, has all those extra apps for those of us who like to spice things up a bit and best of all does a good job.
cie_A	BB	2012-07-08T22:00:00Z	5	what do we do when we dont know it, cant find it, argue about it and wish knew where to buy it? We google it.  what more can you say.

cie_A	Laura Hopkins	2012-07-07T22:00:00Z	5	So many times a day I say 'google it', it's my go to site for information and at work.  Of course it's up to me to weed through the results and determine what to use but I always start with Google.
cie_A	João Teixeira	2012-07-06T22:00:00Z	5	Good to find everything. Nothing that u cant google.Need something? Google it!
cie_A	David Curwen	2012-07-06T22:00:00Z	5	One of the best search engines ever
cie_A	Iseult O'Brien on behalf of Louis O'Brien	2012-07-06T22:00:00Z	3	I often have difficulty weeding through data to reach information rqd.  Even with book title and author's name, for example, I have difficulty getting to appropriate subject field.  Instead, there are wads of uninformative reviews of vaguely related matter which are of no use.
cie_A	gianni Nardoia	2012-07-05T22:00:00Z	4	The announcement of it removal has been a terrible blow for me. Think well, please!
cie_A	Janie Ferrell	2012-07-05T22:00:00Z	5	When you can't remember the products of a country-go to Google.When you don't have time to do your own research-go to Google.When you can't find out how to deal with your children-go to Google.When you have certain symptoms in your body-go to Google.Need ideas for a 50th wedding anniversary?-Google itWhen all else fails-Google it!SOOOOO, why not start with Google first!!!!!
cie_A	Shailendra Patel	2012-07-04T22:00:00Z	5	The best search engine in the world
cie_A	David Cook	2012-07-04T22:00:00Z	1	Still not bringing relevant search results to suit keyword queries any of the time.And charge businesses a fortune in the process.
cie_A	Megan Matusie	2012-07-03T22:00:00Z	4	I like Google and i loads fast. my only complaint is that i don't like the iGoogle because i registered for Google and i don't get a regular Google page even when logged out!
cie_A	Ms N Morney	2012-07-03T22:00:00Z	5	Google is my home page.  What more can I say?Their email service is very user unfriendly, but other than that all their services are amazing.
cie_A	Mr Muscle	2012-07-02T22:00:00Z	1	I dont like Google as I believe that they are controlling what we see. I think they filter things according to a national mandate driven by a New World Order elite overseer. i think there is a massive conspiracy to manipulate traffic rankings and flows because traffic at the end of the day = power and they want to control who has that.
cie_A	Ada J Flores	2012-07-02T22:00:00Z	5	u can find anything on google

cie_A	Elaine O Reilly	2012-07-02T22:00:00Z	5	Google is just brilliant. Its great for helping you find things and other stuff. dont know what i would do without it.

cie_A	Wrtsty White	2012-07-02T22:00:00Z	4	Google is a great search engine, but it has become more and more commercial.
cie_A	David Bond	2012-07-01T22:00:00Z	5	Well, there ARE other search engines but honestly, why would I bother? None offer the speed and interconnectivity that Google does, and the Chrome browser is the best out there.
cie_A	Mary Ellen Bunyan	2012-07-01T22:00:00Z	5	I have tried many search engines and always come back to google. I use chrome and just google as i tend to keep my info pages seperate from my search pages and find that works well on my computer. Chrome is great for news links and things like my weather bug for llocal weather forcasts.  I have never had problems wit google on desktop, lap top, or tablets. One litle grumble i do have is that the corrective search gadget does tend to be way off sometimes. But that said it has made me moe precie in what i search.
cie_A	JoAnna Benert	2012-06-30T22:00:00Z	5	Excellent service had no trouble finding things
cie_A	Rebecca greenwood	2012-06-30T22:00:00Z	5	If your ever stuck on something always use goggle and there are so many different varieties to choose from so you can always have like about 10 different options to choose from. Incredible
cie_A	Goku	2012-06-29T22:00:00Z	5	google translate kick ass !!!
cie_A	Alex	2012-06-29T22:00:00Z	1	Great search engine. HOWEVER: They keep information on you based on your searches without telling you. They then use this information to direct adverts to you that they think you are likely to click on due to the previous searches. Should be more honest and less 'sneaky' for such a big company.
cie_A	eamonn	2012-06-28T22:00:00Z	5	Search on Google hundred times a day and have a gmail account.  Never any problems with either.  Also Android OS is awesome!
cie_A	Scott	2012-06-28T22:00:00Z	5	The only place you need to find anything you could ever want.  A great email service too, very user friendly. Beats Microsoft hands down.

cie_A	Alexis	2012-06-27T22:00:00Z	5	I am usually able to find the information I am looking for with one search, no matter how complicated or specific.
cie_A	ige	2012-06-27T22:00:00Z	3	but that's about it.  it often brings up completely unrelated stuff, but i guess that's part of the overflowing interweb.  i do really hate the fact that the company supports anti access radical groups.
cie_A	lago	2012-06-26T22:00:00Z	2	too much personal info taken
cie_A	Martin James Finnie	2012-06-26T22:00:00Z	5	Best search engine around - longtime user, so easy to find information about pretty much anything on the web.

cie_A	Citizen Rosebud	2012-06-15T22:00:00Z	4	Remember when Google was a search engine? Yeah me too. I loved it as that. Now that it's Facebook lite, and everything else, I'm a little confused. Does it favor it's own websites like YouTube in search results? Probably? Is it going to take over the world so resistance is futile? Most likely? Do I like the fact that its innovative and forward thinking? Most definitely.

cie_A	Rod Mitchell	2012-06-13T22:00:00Z	4	Google has a big head and they think they are the best of the best.  They need to wake up and realize they are NOT the best.  Google Mail absolutely sucks.   I've seen Chinese websites that offer super mail with many options and Google only offers the bare minimum.   I love Google Earth and Google Maps.   I rarely use Google to search and they really should make their home page better.  Come on Google, you're supposed to be an upbeat and cool company.  Improve your mail and make Google the best.   Are you really going to let the Chinese beat you?

It is a brilliant search engine and the only one I need to use. It is always my first stop to compare anything or find anything. Like the name Hoover is a synonym for vacuum, I think Google is a synonym for find!But of course it does not stop there with all the other services like Gmail and Googlemaps...... brilliant

cie_A	Drew Long	2012-04-14T22:00:00Z	1	I used to love Google, used to.....hate it now. Since when do they have my permission to use my Zip and City as a standard for searches? Its supposed to be a search engine not a collar or a USA Spy-Satelite. They went to far and are pushy invaders, like fire ants or crab grass. Not only that their searches are biased and paid for by the people with the top listings, does that say fair or how about honest?Then they turn around and sell your info, I am sure to other companies for profit.....what else do they need to invade you for? Not for polls or truth. You can Suck it, and stick GOOGLE Chrome up your HTTP ASSHOLE~!

cie_A	Vickie Dao	2012-04-07T22:00:00Z	5	I love the Google calendar, which is universally used on most web sites.  Also their Google Voice has no challenge in the world, for what it can do and is free at the same time.

cie_A	Steven Nybo Andersen	2012-03-28T22:00:00Z	3	Google is fine as long as you know that for every search you'll trade a bit of your privacy. I finally found some other search engine that does respects my privacy and are no longer using google except  in rare circumstances. Google is WAY too big to care about peoples privacy now as long as they earn money. Google makes a personalized profile of your personality through your searches and then it only offers results that it knows would please you, letting any upsetting search result behind. It's definitely not objective and transparent. Gmail is still great though.

cie_A	Shepard Ofpeace	2012-03-23T23:00:00Z	2	You can't have a Youtube account unless you have a gmail account.  They've gotten rid of friends and turned them into subscriptions.  My friends have disappeared and seemed to be lost from my subscriptions and I don't recall anyone asking me if that was ok.  And they're new my channel set up sucks.  I was asked if I wanted to switched, I said no, I back weeks later to find it has been changed.On google plus you are required to use a real name.  Why can't I use shepard of peace?  What if I don't want people to know my real name?  What if I don't want current or future employers to find me on google+?  Why can't I decide what is best for me?Google gmail's new page is slower and harder to see.  Luckily though I have been allowed to switch back to the old format.I don't like having my browser history stored online, luckily you can turn that off, but for those who do not know how to turn this off and may not know it is being stored online, this is not fair to them.People do business with people.  Google has gotten to big and is no longer a person but a business.  Its concern is not the customer but the profits.

He says Google's actions here are quite suspect."

cie_A	Paulo Rodrigues	2012-03-13T23:00:00Z	5	I am an old user of Google products and since the time I started to use firstly the search tool, it's getting better over the time with new and useful products. I use them mainly to help find what I want and need but also Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps and Picasa. Also refer the low prices of space allocation compared to rivals. I will always prefer Google if they stay so innovative as they have been.
cie_A	Jake	2012-03-13T23:00:00Z	5	"It speaks for itself whenever you no longer refer to searching on the internet, but ""googling"". Top notch search engine, very popular email service (which I can't comment on further since I don't actively use it) but they really flopped with their social networking site. But did they really need that anyway?"

cie_A	epoussif	2012-03-13T23:00:00Z	3	I'm a google fan. I use it every day, I think around fifty times per day. But didn't you feel that in the recent times, every search results too much in stupidities? Also the commercial links, I mean, if you choose to search in Shopping, it's right, but if you want reviews, descriptions, etc.. Even to find the official website of anything, it's getting really hard. There was too much tricks developed by the web providers (hosting places, web developers, entire books about it) and the result is that google is too much less useful as ever before. No replacement by now, but needed, and sooner or later something will come, if they don't react in time.

cie_A	Peter Crosskey	2012-03-11T23:00:00Z	4	"Since I first knew the internet without any search engines that really stood up to close examination, how can I begin to explain the value of a one-stop shop that defines what today's web user will find (or not)? It's a big responsibility and the next ten years won't be as straightforward as the past ten. But whatever happens ot the desktop environment during that time, Google will be out there supporting the majority platform. So that's web Portal with a capital ""P"". And singular."

cie_A	Louise	2012-03-09T23:00:00Z	3	Works very well but there are competitors in the field who won't trample your privacy. Google chrome is acceptable but not outstanding (although it does have built-in spell corrector). Gmail is very good, I would recommend that.
cie_A	Rebecca	2012-03-09T23:00:00Z	4	When you're looking for something; you google it. There is a reason for this. The easiest of all the online search engines, google is fantastic for searching for broad ideas or concepts. However, if you are wanting to find something very specific, or profession based, you can be stuck searching through hundreds of links that have no real relevance, or you could have only one or two links instead of the wealth of information you normally associate with google.
cie_A	Scott	2012-03-08T23:00:00Z	5	Google offers clients with many free services and the ability to market businesses effectively and cheaply.  I would recommend their marketing to anyone.  It has worked well for myself.In addition services like google voice are a fantastic free service that people should give a try to and experiment with.

cie_A	Ryan	2012-03-07T23:00:00Z	5	"Google by far is the most inovative web provider out there.  They have a complete array of programs and services.  By far my favourite company.  If google made video games, or a video game console, they would be of ""God status""."

cie_A	Nicola from Nottingham	2012-03-06T23:00:00Z	5	Never use any other search engine.  It always comes up with the things I am searching for.  Love the fact you can have your own custom page with your own gadgets on it.  Also like the integration of calendar, email and other options all in one place.

cie_A	Osmanthus Satoria	2012-02-29T23:00:00Z	5	"Great humanity shown in its products, knowing what human need and design everything for ""people"". There is no other company like Google, no other search engine cares what you actually are looking for like Google does.I have been using Google for 11+ years since i had my first laptop, and am spoiled because I always get what i am looking for before I finish my keywords.Google search makes keyword search an Art. I was almost addicted to the beauty of getting what you want by the best keywords combination. I like how I beat myself, and I like how Google surprises me by giving me something out of expectation -- yet related.Search engine opens up my world. It shows you how much 1 word means, and how 1 word x 1 word can be bigger than 1 Million. Gmail is one brilliant product. It shows you how to think out of the box, and you can always make sth better, make ""unlimited"" possible. Since then we have Google Docs, Google Maps, Google Translate. Not just by using them -- they teach me new concepts by being a google product itself. Search for ""Google Translate"" and you will learn about ""statistical machine translation"". I want to know how I get my results when I search it for different purposes, and I want to learn the brilliant ideas behind it -- it looks 100% random, but it isn't. It cares if I get the best of what i need before I realized it.Love Google, 'causeit makes life beautiful."

Google has actually saved me from dealing with the wrong companies by looking for any problems with them. I am very pleased with all Google has done for me. Thank you.

I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!

cie_A	Michael Todd Koren	2012-02-14T23:00:00Z	2	"I used to love this company. But I think the CEO speaks with ""forked tongue"" as they say.  This is my disillusionment with their technological forays - specifically Android related. Google blatantly stole - LIFTED - code directly from Java (Oracle/Sun) and was caught in emails red-handed as daredevils.  Rather than try to be original, they try to reverse-engineer everything Apple - kind of like what Microsoft did with Windows.  I also believe in Karma - what you sew you reap.  Windows is finally suffering that fate.  Will Google?  Time will tell, now won't it?"

It is like stepping through an open door to another world. There are more free services available than I can use. Looking at some of them definitely expands my horizon of the possible. Even better it is always secure. I don't think I could ever use all the available storage.

cie_A	Micksifon	2012-02-01T23:00:00Z	5	I love Google, it's my home screen, I use it all the time and it makes things beautifully easy. I've not used an address bar in years, or a map! I love Google Maps, I don't understand people who own a Tom-Tom and have maps on their phone. I have admit I don't see the point in Google+, like anyone was gonna start allover again after the investment we all made in Facebook. And I was it would stop telling me to download Chrome, when I'm already a Safari user! But these are silly issues and with the amount they try to do, of course things are gonna be......wrong. Love Google!
cie_A	Kevin Hengst	2012-02-01T23:00:00Z	2	While their software seems to be good and their services convenient, the fact that they went out of their way to fire a good engineer just because he was stating a few facts when requested to do so... it's terrible. I have very little trust in Google now.

cie_A	htsetr	2012-01-31T23:00:00Z	4	search is definitely the choice, however the adwords fees keep increasing over the years as the bids will only go up but not down.  my advertising fees had increased 50% from year 2007 to last year 2011.  this is kinda a cheat but too bad there is no much other online advertising competitors that can beat google
cie_A	Tom Fitzherbert	2012-01-31T23:00:00Z	5	Still has the best results, but their new privacy policy of tracking people everywhere they go on the web is a little too Big Brother. Hopefully someone will challenge them soon.
cie_A	Terry Seal	2012-01-30T23:00:00Z	5	I started using other sites, but found google is the one with the answers. The engine picks more answers to your quest then other sites do. Typing in a few characters gets you choices before you have finished the line. So some slate Google about spying, but all of the sites use cookies and unless you delete your cookies. then you are already on someones database. I find sites that ask too many personal questions are not for me. Google is a search engine and a program not a person. So if you want to find it use google.

Once I ""found"" that one can high-light and R-click, in an on-line news article---and have a google search---wow!  Love it!  Thank you to the brainiacts!  <---if that is mispelled, it's cause I don't  have spell check here!  LOLThank you Google!Debbie"
cie_A	Robert White	2012-01-28T23:00:00Z	3	I like the old Google.  I do not like the new Google.  The new Google was forced upon me without my will.   Furthermore, there is almost no way to communicate with Google for help in emergencies.  My account was hacked, re “pinned” and messages sent to my addressees asking for money.   Contacting Google was a nightmare.
cie_A	Stephen Richards	2012-01-28T23:00:00Z	4	It took a long while for me to finally give in and swap search engine providers to Google. I mainly moved as it was everywhere I looked on any decice I used. As a search engine they are great, but lets not forget that is all they are and should concentrate on this. I have a Samsumg Galaxy Nexus and this phone has been ruined by Google and their silly power struggles. The phones no longer sync with Facebook because Google did not want them to. Google is starting to look very silly indeed. If they do not concentrate on their core business then their profits will continue to slide.
cie_A	George Bryans	2012-01-27T23:00:00Z	5	Need a definition, convert grams into ounces, find anything you are looking for, what more is there to say other than it is the best search engine out there and its FREE
cie_A	Sebastien Rose	2012-01-27T23:00:00Z	3	Still be best all-round search engine.Shopping searches often return fake websites based far away around the world and scammers trying to get your money. Google get your act together and don't support these bogus websites!

cie_A	Annie Shakespeare-Bishop	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	The first place for me is Google.   I use it all the time to check on spellings, product information, translations, geographical questions. Google answers the lot!I also look forward to the different Google illustrations.
cie_A	JLow	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	You really only need 1 site/tool for everything these days.
cie_A	Sharon Loken	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	Want to know about something ???  Go to Google.  They seem to have one of the best ways to communicate with folks on the computer.  I try Google first ...  only if I do not get an answer I look elsewhere.  THANKS GOOGLE !!
cie_A	Joshua	2012-01-20T23:00:00Z	5	I don't know what I would do without Google.  The shopping, video, and image tabs make it easy for me to get what I want and Google always has the most relevant sites at the top of the list.

cie_A	Lukas Frimer Tholander	2012-01-19T23:00:00Z	5	Google have the best buissness idea ever, and the AdSense is so awsome for websites, like mine!
cie_A	Shawna	2012-01-19T23:00:00Z	4	Google is my favorite search site because it always shows me what I am looking for.  The pictures are the best and it makes it easy by condensing the pictures into smaller icons enabling you to search through them faster.
cie_A	Peter Risley	2012-01-18T23:00:00Z	5	Brilliant as always
cie_A	Julchen	2012-01-18T23:00:00Z	4	let´s be honest, google is integrated in our lives and I love ebing able to search for anything - AND most properly find it. That´s great! you can prepare vacations and already know everything about the local restaurants of the place you wnat to go before hand. But please, please take our privacy serious!

cie_A	Jules	2012-01-16T23:00:00Z	5	what more can I say a top class search engine.
cie_A	John	2012-01-16T23:00:00Z	5	PhysioRoom has a broader product range than many other sites at very competitive prices.  Delivery is fast and efficient.
cie_A	KEITH	2012-01-16T23:00:00Z	5	Original and best.... IMO. literally got the T- shirt which I won about 10 years ago in a search competition  about 10 years ago (just after they started)
cie_A	John	2012-01-16T23:00:00Z	1	It's time for a change, Google has become stale and boring. The same old logo with the bright colours that treat us like we are still five. It's old and badly needs to update it's image.Plus when you are looking for things it's clear that Google put way too much emphasis on the paid advertising which is a real shame. Search engines should be a way to find things, not pushing crap products they advertise.
cie_A	susan	2012-01-16T23:00:00Z	5	great site. I can always find what I'm lookingfor.

cie_A	JDF	2012-01-14T23:00:00Z	5	Google is one of the best search engines on the net simple to use and gives very intuitive suggestions as you type meaning quite often you only need the first few letters of what your looking for. Also good for email and have done an ace job of the Android OS for smartphones
cie_A	Derek	2012-01-13T23:00:00Z	5	People need to understand, if it isn't on Google, it doesn't exist.

cie_A	James Stephens	2012-01-12T23:00:00Z	5	Whether it's familiarity or what, I cannot bring myself to use any search engine but Google, I can't find fault.  I also use Google for email, and yet again the service is faultless.  Thank you Google.
cie_A	Stephen	2012-01-12T23:00:00Z	5	From search through android to online word processing, this company is the best.  They put microsoft to shame.
cie_A	Jimmy	2012-01-12T23:00:00Z	4	Some new features make the king of searches almost too quick for it's own good - it tries to anticipate your question while your typing and sometimes gives different results if you try the same question twice within a few minutes.

cie_A	Clubmeber	2012-01-09T23:00:00Z	5	No matter what it is I'm searching, google is never far away! I find google really easy to use, its got many different 'apps' attached to it, for example maps, url shortener, images etc. As a search engine it's brilliant - It also allows other programs to feed in to it, for example internet security such as AVG support it. And it's a friendly face when in the need to search for something.
cie_A	Craig Watcham	2012-01-09T23:00:00Z	5	Helps me out all the time!

cie_A	Yosep Sugiarto	2011-11-29T23:00:00Z	5	No complain about Google! is the best!
cie_A	Mr B Thompson	2011-11-29T23:00:00Z	5	Why go anywhere else. This is the only search engine to use.
cie_A	James Holland	2011-11-29T23:00:00Z	5	Not impressed with Android, though!

cie_A	stephyfishy	2011-11-27T23:00:00Z	5	i always use google, it is my homepage and the first thing i go to do searches!
cie_A	peter francis	2011-11-26T23:00:00Z	5	I can't begin to state the wealth of useful information this site has given me. I rarely turn to any other search engine for facts. I am constantly amazed just how many facts are stored on the site and I have yet to ask a question that is not answered logically, clearly, and in depth. A very dear person has just been told she has ovarian cancer and I have been able to reassure her about many questions relating to this dreadful cancer through answers given on Google.
cie_A	ShakeS12	2011-11-26T23:00:00Z	5	Been using Google for years now, and have found them to be the best search engine. Now with Google Chrome, put the two together and you have the best, fastest, web browser on the market. Awesome job.
cie_A	Paul Morriss	2011-11-26T23:00:00Z	5	Google changed the world of search, they made it simple more relevant and more comprehensive - no other search engine to date can compete.  Bing from Microsoft and Yahoo - just don't get it, they can't compete because they are trying to do to many things, they are portals not search engines and whilst it is OK for them do search they will never offer a pure service built on improving search results like Google will.Google stays true to its core value of providing quick, relevant search results enabling you to get what information you want quickly.
cie_A	Brad Cecil	2011-11-26T23:00:00Z	5	Google is by far the best search engine on the web today.

The links are relevant to my search words most of the time. I have had the occasional search that has been pretty irrelevant, but theses are few and very far between. Google, a first choice for me.

cie_A	Terry	2011-10-21T22:00:00Z	3	"After many years of using Google Search, I've found the ability for Google to intelligent suggest alternative variations and correct spelling mistakes to facilitate my search to be useful.However, when using Google Search for looking up certain niche topics or even quite specific searches, Google Search overrides your query and the pages often do not contain elements the original search terms.Should you check the cache, you will often be confronted with a message telling you that pages linking to this page contain your search query while the page you end up on does not and that's if you're lucky!I would appreciate a simple check box that performs a verbatim search for the exact words that I type in. No automatic ""behind the scenes"" suggestions, no dropping very important search words, no replacing ""GLSL"" with ""HLSL"" behind my back for example, and so on.Just a ""Give me what I asked for exactly"" option for those specific times! Please."

cie_A	M Pearson	2011-08-20T22:00:00Z	3	I don't like the way they show pop ups asking to be your home page. Once is perhaps ok but now every time? They need to get humility and back off, if I want them as my home page I'll do it in my own sweet time.

cie_A	Loutjie Lolo	2011-08-15T22:00:00Z	3	I do use Google search at work but I prefer ask.com.

cie_A	Dan Martin	2011-05-19T22:00:00Z	5	These guys are soon going to be making and providing all our services from phones to entertainment to food delivery.Google is the largest and most widespread company I can think of on the internet; and off of it - to cover all grounds from email (Gmail), photos (picasa), maps (earth), social (buzz), tv (GoogleTV), translate (Translate), operating systems (ChromeOS), mobiles (Android)... and the list goes on and on.Im not going to say too much; out of all their products I use GMail, Android and their world-class search engine the most. In which I've never been let down. The only thing is I personally don't like the new Google Image search; but I'm sure this will become better once we're all using faster internet providers.Good luck to Google - and I hope they bring us many more great products in the future.

cie_A	Erik Madsen Greve	2010-12-31T23:00:00Z	1	Everybody is trying to be on the top ten list of Googles search results, but Google is not everything. Its like saying that if you have no friends on Facebook than you have no friends in life. We need to get away from Google and use hundreds of tools that doesn't belong to Google.

cie_A	Doyoulikeduckmeat	2009-08-27T22:00:00Z	5	Beats paypal.com blindfolede with their hands tied behind their backs. It is way safer and much more convinent than giving your credit card to every company you want to shop from on the net. If you have the option to use them do. they follow up quickly ensure your order was recieved costmer service is awsome and hopefully they will blow paypal out of the market. Google in my oppinion has exceled in every venture that I know about and this is just one more great product they offer to the world. Go get'em google.
