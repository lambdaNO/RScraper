amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Lor Olive	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Mensonges, service client nullissime , privil√©gie les acheteurs en toute circonstances, les vendeurs sont trait√©s comme des merdes, syst√®me de commission hallucinant ,  toutes les arnaques sont possibles en tant qu'acheteur sur amazon.Pr√™ts √† tout pour vous arnaquer. La commission qu'il prenne est hyper abusive.  Ecommerce le plus immoral qui soit / les avis sur Amazon sont quasi tous tronqu√©s, la pression est mise de toute fa√ßon sur les vendeurs, alors quand j'entends dire que leur personnel est mal trait√©, je   ne m'√©tonne pas , on ne devient pas l'entreprise la plus riche du monde en √©tant dans le respect..Personnellemtn je me suis retir√© , j'ai boycott√© amazon.
amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Alex McLaren	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	"Amazon used to be good and I had very few errors over the years, and any errors were quickly fixed.Recently they stared to use a delivery company called i-Parcel who are the budget division of UPS. What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery. Such as ""we can't deliver knifes to your location"", but I never ordered a knife, I ordered computer parts!Time to look elsewhere."

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery. Such as ""we can't deliver knifes to your location"", but I never ordered a knife, I ordered computer parts!Time to look elsewhere."

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

amazon	Warren Orr	2018-09-02T22:00:00Z	1	I created a wedding gift list with Amazon. Not only did quite a few items not arrive, but to try and trace these items has been a nightmare. Customer support took forever to acomplish nothing, as they couldn't understand the problem or how to solve it. Eventually I worked out where to find the tracking numbers (as I never ordered myself) and when providing to Amazon, they say they can't track it for me (the recipient), I must contact everyone who sent a gift and ask them to contact Amazon. I cannot believe that this is the process for a wedding gift list!! Wedding registries elsewhere are far better!!!

amazon	Abdula	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	4	Really liked my buy from Amazon. It arrived to me within 2 days of order and that was the  regular delivery method. They are also easy to deal with and have a great choice of items.
amazon	YG	2018-09-04T22:00:00Z	1	Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG

amazon	Farhad Heravi	2018-09-03T22:00:00Z	1	Absolutely atrocious service. Amazon used to be good once upon time. No more. I‚Äôve ordered quite a number of items of the last few weeks and none bar 1 came on time.  Yet their website tracking service showed it as delivered. I looked for it with my neighbours in the block, asked the management company for cameras after speaking to amazon customer service and informing them that even though the item says it was delivered, it was in fact, not delivered so I asked to see the cameras for my apartment so that I can investigate. The CS said he‚Äôs investigating and will call me back in 24hrs, which turned out to be a lie. Items show up 2 days later, however no explanation, no one told me that they were arriving when they did, delivered by amazon and worse, no apology.I‚Äôve since decided to cancel my prime subscription and not to shop with Amazon any longer. Good riddance.

What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery.
